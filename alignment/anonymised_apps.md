* I am fortunate to work in a behavioral core facility, which supports a variety of projects utilizing behavioral experiments across disparate domains related to neuropsychiatric disorders and disease at the NIH.  The knowledge gained from this experience would be instrumental in advancing the research goals of many labs and domains in neuroscience.  I would utilize this knowledge to support the creation and enhancement of research paradigms.  Our current research aims include using these programs to offer solutions to researchers throughout the NIH intramural program who seek to examine live behaviors in a variety of rodent models.  For example, we can advance our abilities to use pose-estimation on reward-seeking paradigms in animals using a platform-mediated operant conditioning task. Here by leveraging both fiber photometry and optogenetic stimulation, we can examine the underlying functional characteristics of K-opioid receptors during decision-based tasks, including anhedonia, and motivation-like behaviors.  We can use this to provide closed-loop experimentation conditions whereby animals can receive stimulation based on poses related to reward-seeking behavior. Through using machine-learning based animal tracking methods available in Bonsai, we could curate experimental procedures and assess potential underlying neural correlates of behavior.  Bonsai and arduino could help to assist with the execution of experiments through an open-source solution to experimentation and data collection, allowing researchers to focus on funding other aspects of their experiments (e.g. viral vectors, histology, etc) and optimally allocate resources to advance science. 

This is just one example, but we support many institutes, and could use this knowledge to support approaches to motor behaviors for animal models of parkinson’s, spatial memory tasks for models of alzheimer’s, decision-based tasks related to addiction, and more. 

The 3d modeling and CAD would be integral to developing new equipment, as it opens opportunities to work with the machine shop on campus which houses 3d printers to develop novel systems currently not on the market that can directly interface with Bonsai and Arduino-based systems to facilitate behavioral neuroscience experiments and provide educational opportunities for trainees including post-baccalaureate and post-doctoral students. For example, these can be used to help provide models for surgery, allowing individuals to practice skills necessary for neurosurgeries that are relevant for their work, but limit the use of animals that otherwise would not be used in study. 

I believe that the skills and knowledge gained during the bootcamp will be essential for the future of research. I am confident that I will be able to use these skills to develop new and innovative behavioral paradigms, advance the research of multiple investigators and the training of students in behavioral neuroscience. and make a significant contribution to the field.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* In my position, developing customized equipment is crucial for precise, sensitive and specific experimentation. Commercially available tools may be unsuitable, so we may create our own specialized equipment, such as mazes or monitoring systems, or adapt existing equipment to suit their requirements. These bespoke solutions allow for tailored analysis of specific rodent behaviors, such as locomotion, social behavior, and cognitive function. However, synchronizing different devices, such as fiber photometry systems and video tracking equipment, can be challenging and requires meticulous attention to detail. Failure to align devices correctly can lead to inaccurate and confounded data, affecting the validity of results, and increases the work on the backend.  Bonsai and Arduino could be critical for addressing this issue, as they are capable of handling these challenges.

Investigators are looking towards our facility to develop methods to behavioral neuroscience experimentation, and we meet these challenges regularly. Bonsai and Arduino offer open-source solutions to help overcome the barriers of lack of funding to sponsor these experiments. 

# Let's imagine you have enough funding - and, more importantly, time - to run a side project (on any topic) with some other people. What would you like to study? What aspects of the project would you like to do by yourself, and what would you prefer to delegate to others? [max 350 words]
* In my dream research project, I would investigate the role of neuropeptides in various brain regions (e.g. septum, amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal regions) in a model of addiction and relapse. To conduct this project, I would develop custom equipment and programs for the experiments, as well as collaborate with experienced animal care technicians to delegate general husbandry tasks and running of the behaviors.

One of the key aspects of this project would be training and collaboration with trainees and students. I would personally work with students to create the programs, run the analysis of data, and perform surgeries for implanting devices. This collaboration would not only ensure that the study is conducted efficiently, but it would also provide valuable training opportunities for the students and promote a collaborative approach that would enhance their educational experiences that they can carry forth throughout their careers, should they stay in academia or research. I would want to work with students throughout the project, also creating opportunities for them to create their own side projects, as it should be an empowering experience where students feel ownership of their work, as their work is immensely valuable.

Animals would undergo a self-administration protocol followed by a withdrawal period, and then be exposed to different stress levels with varying housing conditions. Emotive behaviors and cognitive tasks would be assessed at baseline, after the self-administration protocol, and after withdrawal. Animals would then undergo an optional self-administration paradigm to evaluate their relapse potential. I would create opportunities for social components to be added to these existing paradigms, which would necessitate novel equipment development not readily available, and allow for an examination of the role of social stress on these measures in addiction and relapse modeling.

Overall, this project would provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying addiction and relapse, as well as the effects of stress and housing conditions on these processes. By collaborating with trainees and students and delegating tasks appropriately, I could conduct the study efficiently while maintaining a high level of rigor and precision in the experiments.

* I'm currently looking into color changes in H.Burtoni fish in the context of social interaction based behavior and classes of dominant and submissive color traits. Since the social behavior in groups of fish is typically dependent on behaviors like aggression, dominant-submissive dual interactions in changes of color etc., I think behavior analysis in this context could help. This project assumes nothing much about the internals of fish in general and has a focus on interactive behavior but I think the motivations behind these interactions could be a follow-up study based on how the research takes shape. I've been working on this project for a long time and progress hasn't been easy to make because of my life commitments and the lack of an official role at CUNY related to the project. Currently, progress has been made wrt fish annotations of different body parts separately to create a composite segmentation problem statement. Additional fish data has been collected to create a larger problem statement involving detection of features of fish as a self-supervised problem. U-Nets have been chosen as the model of choice for now with some ablations in Mask RCNN for future work once initial progress has been made. Looking for potential co-authors who can join me for this project from the Summer school potentially. The project uses the GPU resources set up at the lab by Prof. Alvarado with ~24GB GPU capacity and a focus on feature extraction in the context of limited availability of annotated data. I believe the influence from behavioral neuroscience can add to the research paper by giving some context around explaining the behaviors better from a biological motivation point of view instead of just the social interaction point of view.  
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* Feature extraction in the context of limited availability of annotated / supervised data means without the existence of pre-trained models to support fine-tuning based performance benefits, getting performance that doesn't result in too much error propagation across tasks becomes crucial given the black-box components of the underlying neural network based implementation. Compatibility of algorithms in the context of CPU implementations being unable to interact with the PyTorch code base without code re-write has been a problem related to time and amount of CS help in the ecology lab.

* The questions around the differences between genetics and epigenetics have been a cause for curiosity for a long time in terms of the influences I've had in my life. I've lived through curious cases of epigenetic conditioning around behavior analysis including cows in NIT Trichy acting strange around loud music, studies related to plant growth in the context of music, other liquids for growth, mosquitos becoming adept at bloodsucking because of fear of death, flies hovering over my head in large numbers in the evenings etc. I would be interested in any epigenetics related project that might study the changes in behavior in species. I would like to be responsible for the code base and coding aspects of the project. I would prefer to delegate the neuroscience related problem statement construction and direction setting to others as much as I can.

* My direction of doctoral research is the philosophy of mind, with a focus on the phenomenology of creativity. My research often interacts with tools and frameworks from cognitive and behavioral neuroscience. So, there are two different contexts in this interdisciplinary research: one in philosophy, the other in neuroscience. The eventual goal of my research project is to integrate the computational and embodied views on cognition, and push the analytic branch of the philosophy of mind to evolve. By "evolve," I mean that philosophy of mind from the analytic tradition must move past its obsessive focus on symbolic language and logic, and broaden its lines of inquiry into both brain and behavior in the context of the whole organism and environment. I feel this is an inevitable step for the philosophy of mind, so I want to be a pioneer pushing the boundaries, and propel the field to take this step earlier than later. 
					
The knowledge and skills from the school will help me on two fronts. 

One, because my work is focused on theory, I hope that I can develop more skills in empirical paradigms and experiment setups, data analysis, and hypothesis evaluations. I already sketched plans of empirical experiments on observing and monitoring creative behaviors, and learning how to properly state hypothesis, set up experiments, and frame them in the context of behavior paradigms (or come up with new ones) will be very helpful.  
					
Two, I have worked on machine learning projects and 3D printing, but not in the context of behavioral neuroscience experiments that involved 3D design and printing. TBNSS feels like a good place to exercise my existing skills in the new context of behavioral neuroscience research. Also, in my planned experiments that monitor creative activities, I'll need to control setups by changing visual and mechanical stimuli, so these skills provided in TBNSS -- experiment design, input control, and data analysis -- aligns very well with my research plans.
					
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* I haven't started my PhD yet, but based on my plan of research direction, I envision that typical experiment problems will involve the monitoring of creative activities, and the study of how conscious experience is embodied physically, in complex environments. For example, in multi-person social settings, how cognitive states and emotional states may interact in the mind, and produce certain physical manifestations that are observable by empirical approaches? How does this multi-person setting differ from a single, individual setting, in terms of spurring creative activities? If there are kinesthetic responses, how might they feedback into conscious mental states, and alter perceptual or cognitive experiences in individuals? 
					
Part of those experiments need empirical data collection and analysis based on behavioral neuroscience, part of them needs philosophical reasoning and explanations, so these experiments are interdisciplinary by nature. I will need to scope down and further specify what those experiments may entail, how to set them up, run them smoothly, and correctly interpret data to evaluate the outcome. So I hope that at TBNSS, surrounded by experienced empirical researchers, I'll learn the key skills in data analysis and behavioral paradigm development, and to apply them in my interdisciplinary research experiments.

* 1. The project: I'd like to study the brain mechanisms for memory and motor control, for example, how do musicians play music from memory? What are the neuroscience and kinesthetic basis of this remarkable feat? What kind of conscious experience does this activity provide, and in what ways and phenomena does creativity factor into it?
                                        
2. What I'd like to do by myself: (1) research: defining projects from grand vision to small details; set the tone, topic, area, and lines of inquiry into specific problems; apply theories to frame and scope practical problems and experiments, etc; breaking down and specifying big, vague problems to specific, measurable small chunks. (2) design, review, and evaluate experiments, and draw conclusions from them; (3) operations: staffing different projects, managing grant and other forms of money; forming partnerships, collaborations, and navigating bureaucracy. [ I started doing (3) because no one really wanted to do it, and it turned out that I happen to be good at it.]
                                        
3. What I'd like to delegate: checking progress on individual projects; empirical experiments and observations without theoretical framing beforehand; empirical data collection post-observation. And if someone else can and want to do it, all aspects specified in point (3) ("operations: staffing different...") in the previous answer.

* My project is about how neuromodulators are involved in complex social behavior in Pogonomyrmex barbatus ants. Most eusocial animals exhibit temporal polyethism, changes in behavior associated with age. In many hymenopterans, young workers are in charge of intranidal labor, such as caring for the queen and brood, whereas old workers perform extranidal tasks, including nest defense and foraging. Neuropeptides, such as the ones related to Oxytocin/Vasopressin, are highly conserved and are crucial for social behavior in many taxa. Another important group of neuromodulators are the monoamines, and in my project I am focusing on two, dopamine and octopamine. The distribution and function of Inotocin, the insect orthologue, has been studied in some ant species and has been found to be related to metabolism, cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, and modulation of foraging behavior. However, the distribution of the mature peptide is unknown. In the case of monoamines, works in other ant species show the distribution of some aminergic neurons using immunofluorescence assays against the proper neurotransmitter or to enzymes related to this molecules’ synthesis, and have been linked to behaviors ranging from defense, aggression, division of labor, reproductive dominance, and foraging.
My time as a master’s student is coming to an end, and I am eager to continue my academic journey by pursuing a doctoral degree. I truly believe that further research in this area will be scientifically valuable. I am eager to explore this topic more comprehensively by incorporating techniques to measure physiological dynamics in live tissue (non-fixated), as well as integrating behavioral assays to the methodology. Doing so will facilitate a holistic understanding of the topic and make a meaningful contribution to the field.
The Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School is exactly the opportunity I have been seeking in the last few years. This program will provide a complementary framework to my current research, enabling me to conduct sophisticated experiments that would otherwise be impossible to achieve. The hands-on experience of designing and building three-dimensional printed setup as well as  using electronic controllers will enhance the quality and quantity of data collected. Moreover, incorporating machine learning tools will facilitate the recognition of patterns that would be challenging to discern through manual analysis, promoting the reduction of time spent in such tasks. I am convinced that this program will not only expand my technical skill, but also contribute significantly to the advancement of my research goals.

* I am a graduate student in the field of neurobiology. My current research project is about the differential anatomical distribution of neuromodulators in two adult stages of red harvester ants. In my project, I use different techniques to stain the neuromodulator positive neurons and obtain images, such as Immunofluorescence, RNA FISH and Confocal Microscopy. Working with literal ant sized tissue can be challenging and a common problem is maintaining the tissue integrity and preventing the tissue loss between washes. 
Our laboratory is almost three years old, and faces challenges that are common to newly established laboratories. The main issue that concerns us is the lack of a stable, productive and healthy ant colony to provide us with sufficient individuals for our research. I truly believe that this problem can be solved by gaining more precise control over ambient variables such as  noise, light, temperature and humidity. Such precision can be achieved with 3D printing and arduino controlled devices. In addition, we have yet to successfully implement various methodologies that would help us to obtain more robust and elegant results. The most notable is behavioral analysis. Ants display age polyethism, changes in behavior associated with age, and I am certain that video analysis will help us to understand the complexities of this phenomenon.
Attending the TBNSS could be a transformative opportunity for me and our laboratory. I am confident that this program will provide us with the methodologies and knowledge necessary to achieve our goals and advance in our research substantially.

* Eusociality, the division of reproductive tasks among castes in a colony, has independently evolved across multiple evolutionary lineages, some of which are phylogenetically distant. Phenotypic plasticity plays a critical role in the development of eusociality, allowing external cues to promote caste formation and division of labor. While individuals in a colony share genetic similarity, their behavior and development are shaped by environmental factors that affect the neuromodulatory systems in their brains. However, the extent of these differences in neuromodulation among eusocial species is currently unknown.
To better understand the role of neuromodulation in the emergence of complex social behavior and work division, it is crucial to examine the similarities and differences in these systems among eusocial animals. By doing so, we can gain insights into how the evolution of eusociality may have led to the emergence of sophisticated behavior in different species and the convergence in cellular, physiological and behavioral levels.
To investigate the role of neuromodulation in eusocial behavior, the proposed methodology will involve pharmacological intervention and behavioral analysis. Specifically, we will compare the effects of pharmacological agents (agonists, antagonists) that target neuromodulatory systems in three distinct species of eusocial animals, such as naked mole rats, bees, wasps, ants, termites, and the sponge-dwelling shrimp (Synalpheus regalis). Behavioral assays will be conducted to measure changes in stereotypical behaviors related to division of labor in response to these interventions and will involve video capture, analysis, and tracking using 3D-printed and Arduino-controlled devices.
I would love to study this topic in ants, and I would delegate the interaction with other species to other research groups that are experts in other species.
By comparing the anatomical, functional, and behavioral aspects of neuromodulation across multiple species, this research will provide insights into the neural basis of complex social behavior in eusocial animals. Ultimately, this work could have broader implications for the study of social behavior and communication in other animals, including humans.

* TBN Summer School explicitly help me to understand some of the behavioral experiment design techniques and strategies in the research work where it contributes to analysis of data to the interpretation of result in the field of interdisciplinary research which usually a part of the conceptual debate. Further understanding takes an interest to develop the international collaboration that will focus the studying the realistic mechanisms of animal models through communication and processing in simple and complex environments by using advanced computational tools and techniques.

Moreover, the lectures and hand-on experience aim to focus on mentoring and innovation challenges (a place where individuals from different nations work under one rooftop where I will acquaint myself such vast numbers of new things such as design and setup of 3D printing, Arduino and Bonsai concept for behavioral tracking and closed-loop experiments and advanced machine learning tools/libraries). And provide ample opportunities for direct interactions between the lecturers and the attendees which help me to strengthen my adroitness such as critical thinking/hand-on experience through project management.

Summer School helps me to get more insight of the situations sometime questions arise in my mind “How animal studies provide insight in the neural basis of behavior more effectively" and develop new strategies based on hypothesis. While presenting my poster at ARO conference in Florida, related to behavioral experiment, I figured out there are lot of studies conducting on animal not only in the behavioral neuroscience but using interdisciplinary approaches too. Some people use Owls, mouses and other different animals to understand the neural mechanisms how the brain works and how it relates to behavior. Later, I would like to share my experience about the tool-revolution and new step towards the behavioral research as it offers diverse student body, develops innovation... that changes lives, foster development and positive societal change.

Moreover, I believe it acquaint with such huge numbers of new things about up growing technology in behavioral neuroscience. I think I can find everything here from very applied science to fundamental & theoretical and it's an extraordinary open door for students in few weeks to have an exposure with context, concepts, tools and diversity through interdisciplinary approaches which more often neglected, but not now.

* I reckon the pandemic doesn’t affect my life schedule too much, just slightly.  Due to the Covid for a while (few months), we had to stop working on the experiment as we can’t invite subject based on protocol. 

I remember last year, when scheduled to collect data, then I approach a lot of students to take participate in my research as it is a three consecutive days data collection, mostly student denied or mentioned they didn't have time to come around. After that I decided that I will provide money as compensation from my research grant, still there some issues, as student think while being on experiment maybe their ears have some problem if they listen and attention to those sounds at different frequency. Though it's not the case and due to the safety, we signed the contract before data collection. Last time it happened in Boston University, data collection was on going and one senior came down and claiming he had some issues in hearing after our experiment which is not the case. 

Moreover, after data collection it happened once while analyzing the data, we figured out that one of the devices is not working/connected properly and due to the fact, we have to do the process again to make sure there would no chance of error. If the apparatus gets faulty then it takes time to import from US/Canada supplier (in most cases), which also slow down the research part a bit for few days.

* Primary Goal: Rehabilitation Patient and families is to become functionally as independent as possible before transition.

Today, with the ever-growing demand of the Clinical practice and every second, the transition to new technology in the health system, Required up-gradation on wellness in all its form. In this study, we are evaluating rehabilitation path or plan (patient can rehab. in the clinic, prioritize to the high-risk patient, second option, the patient can rehabilitate at home which is less costly usually for the low-risk patient and third option, the patient can rehabilitate at home with periodic physiotherapy visit). And monitoring whether the patient receives the right care or not using a system approach which allows to get data out what is
happening in the prevention system in a local community with stakeholders, guiding and directing the nature of data and how we go back about collecting it more than that we are taking that back into the community to help us interpret what that means locally in the identification of the key problem.

As all of us know that remote care patient monitoring and giving care out of clinic and monitoring is more and more common. One of the big challenges is how to collect data remotely and make it interoperable with other data sources like (EMR data, pharmacy data, scheduling data, demographic data) that’s major challenges which come into lack of health data interoperability and the tools and services. We start looking at building scalable solution for building this data with security and privacy, enable remote monitoring scenarios.

* Starting this year, I have encountered difficulties in my financial situation as a PhD student due to current circumstances. I rely solely on my monthly stipend to cover my expenses, which has become challenging due to high variable interest rates on my student loan. Additionally, the institutional grant I receive only covers a fraction of the total cost of summer school/travel expenses. These constraints have prevented me from utilizing the grant, resulting in limited resources compared to local or EU individuals. Consequently, despite being accepted for opportunities, I have had to decline them due to my financial limitations as an immigrant international student. Due to this reason, I reckon, to be considered for financial support.

* My primary research interest is understanding the neural mechanisms involved in different memory processes in classical conditioning. Currently, I am working on a project titled "Neural Bases of Aversive and Appetitive Memory Persistence after Retrieval." The focus of this project is to explore how the amygdala and prefrontal cortex interact during memory formation, persistence, and inhibition. To carry out this project, I am undergoing training in various techniques such as animal handling and training, behavior analysis, making electrodes (tetrodes), performing brain surgery for electrode implantation, extracellular recording in behaving animals, and different aspects of signal analysis, from spike sorting to coding. My aim is to perform simultaneous tetrode and silicon probe recordings in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, analyze neuronal interactions during memory retrieval and extinction in freely-moving animals, and use optogenetics to induce rhythmic activity in these brain areas to observe the effect on the engagement of different memory processes. Moreover, I am currently interested in developing and refining methods for automating behavior detection to increase the accuracy of behavioral data and establish stronger correlations between neural activity and behavior.
This course offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge experimental tools that I am planning to use in the near future. It covers behavioral monitoring tools which will be essential for my research to automatically detect specific behaviors, quantify them, and react with a close-loop system to optogenetically stimulate specific brain areas. The electronics concepts covered in this course will definitely help me improve my recording setup, as I am currently having problems with noise in the signal. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to learn from the distinguished faculty at TBNSS, who are experts in these techniques. I am also looking forward to sharing a few days of fun with other students who are likely to have very similar neuroscientific interests. Overall, I believe that the TBNSS course will provide me with the training and knowledge I need to further my research.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The main problem I am encountering today in my experiments is noise in my electrophysiological signal. For these experiments, I am using an Open Ephys acquisition board and an Arduino to control the stimuli presentation and to send TTL pulses to the acquisition board. I built this circuit from scratch with little knowledge of electronics and I suspect that some component of this circuit may be responsible for the noise in my signal. I have already tried disconnecting several of these but the problem continues and makes it challenging to detect spikes of neurons in the middle of this noise.
Another problem I have in my experiments has to do with the quantification of behavior. I am recording my experiments with a webcam and at the moment I am quantifying the freezing and reward-seeking behavior by hand. Watching hours and hours of videos is not very pleasant and in turn introduces a subjectivity bias in the quantification. I want to move towards automatic quantification with Bonsai and maybe Deeplabcut, but so far I have not achieved a good result. It is important to be able to do this because I need to determine as precisely as possible when a behavior starts and stops, so that I can then analyze the electrophysiological signal related to this event.

* I have always wanted to be able to study animal behavior in a more natural situation, such as in their own homecage with other animals, because in those conditions animals show a wider range of behaviors. This used to be difficult to do. In general, you tried to reduce the degrees of freedom of your experiment in order to get closer to an analysis. I think with the advance of the latest automated analysis tools, you could record and analyze hours and hours of behavior, even while they are sleeping, and get more out of laboratory animals. I would like to do wireless electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus to study the replay of certain patterns of activity that occur during sleep that replicate activity that was present during wakefulness. Finally, I am interested in investigating the role of sleep in the consolidation of certain memories. In my project, I would like to develop a way of working that uses as few animals as possible and extracts as much data as possible from each animal. By recording many hours of behavior and electrophysiological activity, the same animals could provide data for several projects in parallel. I would focus on analyzing the sleep part, but then other members of the project could look at social interaction, place cells, anxious behavior, etc. I would like my project to consist of a team where we are all involved in the set-up construction, animal surgery and initial analysis of the behavior and electrophysiological signal, but then everyone has their own mini-project where they study a particular aspect of the behavior. I think this could work much better than a working group where everyone has their own project, does all the work on their own, and uses their own animals instead of sharing them with their other group mates.

* Unfortunately, my lab and I are not able to cover the registration fee. Argentinian science is suffering strong cuts in budget and grants and fellowships are getting slimmer by the day with the local currency depreciation. Lately, my thesis supervisor has not been successful when applying for funding for the project, so this type of activity, such as attending courses or conferences, has become a second priority for the lab and it will not be possible to pay for this registration fee.

* During animal locomotion, different muscles contract in an orchestrated way to produce an effective movement. For that to occur, the neurons that innervate them, distributed in different segments along the body, must coordinate their activity. I’m interested in the mechanisms that generate this intersegmental coordination. I am working on elucidating this question on the leech (Hirudo sp.) nervous system composed of a head brain, 21 midbody ganglia and a tail brain. Each midbody ganglion innervates a segment and contains the neural network necessary to produce the repertoire of motor patterns displayed by the animal. Experimentally, the motor patterns can be studied in isolated nerve cords or single ganglia, through extracellular recordings of root nerves. Specifically, I have been working on leech crawling, a terrestrial rhythmic displacement of the animal on solid surfaces. I have shown that dopamine elicits fictive crawling in isolated chains of three ganglia, which exhibit highly coordinated activity with the expected anteroposterior order. This indicates that three ganglia chains bear the neural elements that provide coordination signals, independent from cephalic or peripheral ones. My current goal is to characterize the coordination signals. I would like to compare my findings on fictive crawling with a precise description of coordination among the different segments of the leech body during the actual behavior. There are some descriptions in the literature, but they are quite rudimentary. I want to attend the school to learn how to do a detailed kinematic analysis of leech crawling using an automated tracking software like DeepLabCut. Nobody at my lab has experience with behavioral experiments, so they will also benefit with the knowledge I gained. Apart from that, I’ve designed 3D printed components in the electrophysiological setup using guidance from others; it will be highly valuable for my research to build specially designed objects.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* Crawling consists of anteroposterior waves of circular muscle contraction, which elongates the body forward, followed by longitudinal muscle contraction, which brings the tail towards the head. To evaluate the intersegmental coordination I isolate chains of ganglia and evoke episodes of fictive crawling by superfusion of dopamine. I make extracellular recordings of a root nerve from each ganglion, through which axon of different motoneurons projects, and that can be classified using a spike-sorting algorithm. Contraction and elongation phases in the recordings are established through the bursting of well identified motoneuron spikes. Data analysis is performed using custom written Python scripts. These studies detail the phase relationship of the crawling motor pattern in each ganglion, and the coordination throughout the three ganglia. However, we do not know to what extent this fictive behavior matches the actual behavior of the animal. To answer this question, a thorough kinematic analysis is vital.

* It would be great to be able to record the activity of the whole population of ganglion neurons during fictive crawling to identify all the neurons involved in each phase of this behavior and their activation sequence. Using BAPTA-AM based calcium indicators is not an option because leech cells don’t have intracellular esterases. Very recently, a transgenic leech line (Helobdella sp.) with pan-neuronal GCaMP6m expression has been developed from an international collaboration. I expect this transgenic line will help us to dissect the neural network underlying crawling. Apart from that, I’m interested in crawling as an escape response. Helobdella leeches respond to poking in the posterior sucker with crawling. I would like to study how a mechanical stimulus evokes this response. I have a lot of very interesting questions that could be answered in this system: How leeches respond to mechanical stimuli of varying intensities in different parts of the body? Is the head brain (or tail brain) necessary for the escape response? Which are the neurons involved, from the sensory neurons to the motoneurons? New transgenic lines with neuron type-specific expression of different fluorescent markers (GFP, mCherry, etc) would be really useful for determining the neural circuit involved. These transgenic animals are generated in the frame of a collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Weisblat at UC Berkeley (US) and Dian Hang Kuo at Taipei University (Taiwan).

* The main objective of my project is to evaluate the learning ability of the Rhodnius prolixus kissing bug in different behavioral stages related to mating. Our research group has been investigating the cognitive abilities of these insects for years, but so far, no learning experiments have been conducted in the sexual context. In this project, we carry out different protocols of classical and operant conditioning, both appetitive and aversive, on each behavioral stage of mating. These stages may include partner searching, male copulation attempts, female acceptance/rejection, and post-copulatory surveillance, among others. In our experiments, we mainly evaluate the behavioral response of insects, so I believe that the course contents can be of great help, not only to obtain a deeper behavioral analysis but also for the design of much more appropriate experimental devices. All our experiments must be carried out under controlled conditions of light, temperature, and relative humidity, for which the use of Arduino can be very useful. The behaviors we study are characterized by having a temporal variable that will change (increase or decrease) as insects learn, for example, time to find the female, latency to copulation attempts, post-copulatory guarding time, among others. That is why the contents given in the course can be of great use, as they can help me find tools for a more precise and complete data analysis. Finally, for our experiments, we need experimentally designed arenas for insects, and possibly 3D printing could be of great help for the correct design of the same or for experimental devices such as mazes in which to carry out olfactory experiments, among others.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* When conducting our experiments, insects are filmed from the surface of the experimental arena in order to analyze their behavior and interfere as little as possible. However, this creates a problem in that some other behaviors that could be of interest, such as the male's antennal movement when approaching the female or the female's rejection behavior in response to the male's copulation attempt, such as abdominal movement or stridulation, cannot be perceived, and we may be missing important information. It would be interesting to be able to analyze these behaviors, especially in insects that have undergone some kind of training where a variation of these behaviors that we are unable to observe may be indirectly generated.
The experimental arenas we use are often recycled glass containers from previous experiments, which are very useful but may not be entirely suitable for the experiments we are carrying out. Therefore, it would be of great utility to be able to design experimental arenas that are suitable for our experiments and thus make the most of all the information that can be extracted from the experiments.

* One problem we often encounter is the lack of appropriate tools to quantify all the behaviors insects perform during experiments. Much subtler behaviors such as male antennal movements during sexual mate search or female rejection behaviors in response to male copulation attempts, such as stridulation, abdominal raising or crushing, cannot be accurately observed and quantified. This is due to the fact that our experiments are filmed from the surface of the experimental arena in order to interfere as little as possible in the insects' behavior. Being able to quantify these behaviors with new tools would be very helpful. In addition, the experimental arenas we typically use are recycled glass containers from previous experiments, which are very useful but pose difficulties in manipulating insects and, as previously mentioned, in filming them. Having experimental arenas that allow us to film all insect behaviors and having the appropriate tools to count them in the best possible way would be a significant advancement in our research.

* The research group I am part of belongs to the University of Buenos Aires, located in Argentina. Nowadays, the economic situation of our country is not very favorable, and many research groups do not have funding for their projects. The Insect Physiology Laboratory, where I am pursuing my doctorate, fortunately has funding granted by the University of Buenos Aires, specifically allocated to the purchase of experimental supplies such as insects, PCs, digital cameras, experimental devices, and others. However, unfortunately, it is not sufficient to cover expenses related to conferences, workshops, travel, or scientific courses. Given this, receiving a scholarship or funding would be the only option that would allow me to participate in the course and take advantage of the tools provided in it. Considering the usefulness of the course and how necessary it is for my project and that of my colleagues, being able to attend would enable significant progress in our current and future research.

* My project aims to understand the neuronal substrates and physiology of emotional contagion in rodents. Emotional contagion refers to the spontaneous sharing of emotion and behavior between individuals. It is found in social animals and it is believed to constitute an adaptive mechanism to identify threats and opportunities. Specifically, we are using a behavioral paradigm of observational pain. We are attempting to describe brain areas and circuits involved in the perception of pain and distress of others, as well as to determine how the pupil, a hallmark of arousal, can correlate with neuronal activity and with pain stimuli. This work consists of behavioral tests performed on head-fixed mice habituated to run on a treadmill while running velocity is continuously monitored. During the test phase, one mouse observes (observer) the other (demonstrator) receiving a series of mild electric shocks on the tail base while pupil dynamics are monitored. Pupil dynamics demonstrated to be a good readout of observational pain: mice receiving an electric shock dilate the pupil proportionally to the stimulus intensity and, strikingly, observers respond in the same fashion when shocks are delivered to the demonstrator. We observed that the sight of the other is not necessary for emotional contagion in rodents as a black screen between subjects still allows it. The setup consists mostly of custom-made hardware and software. For the analysis of task-dependent neuronal activation we are using immunofluorescence. Specifically, we use antibodies against the protein product of C-fos, whose transcription in neurons is initiated in an activity-dependent manner. We will use correlation methods to couple pupillary dynamics to neuronal activity, measured as the density of C-fos positive cells in brain areas. This analysis will be performed at a whole-brain level using light-sheet microscopy after brain clarification (CLARITY). Finally, we will use 2-photon microscopy to better delineate neuronal activity in interesting areas using genetically encoded calcium indicators.
Knowledge acquired during the summer school will increase the power of my project. Especially with regards to Arduino programming and 3D printing which will help me obtain other physiological parameters during tests, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, by building custom hardware. Another important parameter to record in this project will be vocalizations. Knowledge in DeepLabCut will be useful for monitoring the movement of animals and it could be correlated with other parameters. Bonsai will be very useful in managing all the different parameters and hardware. I am eager to learn Bonsai because it is not being used yet in our laboratories, so it will be something new and valuable for our research.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One common experimental challenge I meet is in optimizing tools and hardware for my specific needs. Often, I must seek the help of those with more experience in electronics and programming to overcome these obstacles. To become more self-sufficient and explore diverse experimental settings, I’d like to acquire skills in these areas. The main technical issue that we often encounter is the recording of the two animals simultaneously. We are not able to record all our desired parameters for both the demonstrator and the observer because we are meeting problems in the synchronization of these simultaneous recordings and also hardware is missing to achieve this ultimate goal. Up till now, during the test phase, we are recording pupil dynamics and velocity only in observers. Nonetheless, we are still obtaining good results. Recording these parameters also in the demonstrator will allow us to compare the animals and better describe the dynamics of emotional contagion.

* I am interested in investigating the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior in autism using rodent models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Behavioral paradigms I would like to use are the three-chamber test and the social novelty test. I would like to explore the role of the gut microbiota in these mechanisms. I plan to use high-definition and high-velocity cameras for video-tracking to perform offline analysis of movements from multiple points of view. Infrared thermography will be useful to better delineate the behavioral and physiological aspects of sociability. I will also attempt to perform analysis of pupils, whiskers, rhinarium and ears movements and dynamics with multiple head-mounted cameras: this will likely be one of the main challenges, but if successful, it will allow for correlation analyses with brain activity in freely moving animals. If not possible, recordings will be done in social presentation experiments with head-fixed animals. The next step will be to record the activity of neurons in freely moving mice during the same behavioral tests using fiber photometry and genetically encoded calcium indicators. The areas of interest for these recordings will be chosen based on what is obtained from whole-brain C-fos immunofluorescence analysis. The same experiments and analyses will be repeated with gut microbiota manipulations, such as antibiotic or probiotic treatment, to investigate whether they can influence mice sociability, movements, and neuronal activity. If some rescue of phenotype is obtained in ASD mouse models, I would further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota could influence the brain. I will do vagotomy experiments to understand if microbiota-mediated effects are dependent on vagal transmission. I could delegate to other scientists 16s rRNA sequencing on feces of mice to individuate characteristic bacterial strains and further analyze their involvement in the different phenotypes. This could open the possibility for probiotic treatments in ASD.
I would like to take on the task of designing and implementing the behavioral experiments, building and programming needed hardware as well as surgeries and data analysis. I would delegate microscope acquisitions and related analysis to other team members.

* My master's degree project aims to characterize the sensory-motor integration during active object exploration of an autochthonous weakly electric fish, Gymnotus omarorum. Weakly electric fish have an active sensory modality consisting of electric discharges generated by a specialized organ. These electric discharges generate an electric field around the fish's body, from which they can sense perturbations thanks to electroreceptors on its skin. During active sensing, the fish are capable of modulating their information uptake in two ways: via the frequency of their electric discharges and via the positioning of its body in respect to the object causing the perturbation in the field.
To characterize this active exploration I will test locomotor and electric activity in response to a stimulus in the water near the fish. The experimental design consists of night-long recordings of electric and locomotor behavior, via electrodes in the fishtanks and video cameras, respectively. At different points during the night an object will turn on (programmed on Bonsai) as a stimulus for the fish. The objects will consist of a carbon dipole on an on/off circuit connected to an Arduino and controlled via Bonsai. I have little experience with Arduino programming and would greatly benefit from the school in this regard. 
Since I intend to correlate the locomotor response with the electric modulations, I need precise and synchronized video and electric recordings. Therefore, I would benefit from doing the data acquisition completely via Bonsai. I have been independently learning about Bonsai, but I would benefit from formal training on it. 
Since my project consists of a characterization, there are no validated motor patterns to look for. For this reason I will take advantage of new technologies such as DeepLabCut and non-supervised algorithms to find these patterns. I’m already familiar with python programming in general. However, I still need to train on the specifics of animal tracking. 
Lastly, and since I’m working with a non-traditional animal model, knowing the basics of 3D printing might be an advantage to my future work. Usually we work with tools designed for traditional models, that we have to adapt for our particular model. Being able to design and print my own tools, specific for my project needs, would be of great interest to me and my laboratory. 

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* A typical experimental problem I face on my research is the high amount of data generated. Until now, my laboratory has been using traditional data analysis methods which are mainly manual. However, for the kind of project I've planned, this methods are very time consuming and prone to human error. 
Furthermore, the kind of biological signals I record are often noisy and requiere an important pre-analysis processing. 
On a more practical standpoint, and as I mentioned above, I need precise synchronization between the two kinds of data being recorded, which is not possible with the current setting and methodology of my lab.

* I am very interested in the different sensory-motor strategies employed by different organisms to enhance their information uptake from the environment. These sensory-motor loops are found in a variety of species, from spiders tensing their webs to prioritize certain locations where prey or partners could be found, to our own sense of touch. 
Given enough time and funding, I would like to do a comparative study across species on the basis of these strategies. An interesting model for this would be echolocation in bats. Are there similarities across active sensory modalities between echolocation and electrolocation in fish? The specifics of this project in order to make it comparable between species would have to be thoroughly thought out, though.  
In this side project, and in my current project, I feel more comfortable working on the theoretical and analytical part. For instance, I would greatly enjoy modeling an analog of the Electric Image in weakly electric fish for a bat’s “Acoustic Image”. This would entail an analysis of the sensory input on a bat’s ears, and how this would change in respect to the bat’s movements and/or modulations of its vocal emissions.  I would also prefer to be involved in the experimental design and data analysis. 
On the other hand, I would prefer to delegate the animal handling and the experimental part to other members of the project. 
Given that echolocation has been greatly studied in bats, though, complementary studies could be made with other species such as some whales. Furthermore, even though comparisons with invertebrates are a huge leap, I would enjoy studying the sensori-motor strategies of, for instance, jumping spiders and their visual system.

* My current work and interest are in studying the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making in mice. We are using in-house built polyamide flexible probes to record in-vivo activity from various brain regions of mice/rats. During school, attending tutorials on designing and building experimental setups and data analysis using machine learning tools like DeepLabCut would be highly beneficial for my current goals and future aspirations.
Although I understand that my focus is on mice rather than fruit flies, the skills and knowledge gained during summer school can still be useful in several ways.

Firstly, I can use the principles of experimental design and data analysis learnt in summer school to improve my experimental protocols and to more effectively analyse my data. For example, like the fly experiments, I incorporate visual and mechanical stimuli into mice experiments to better control their behavioural responses. I also heavily use open-science tools like Arduino and Bonsai to conduct closed-loop experiments, in which the experimental setup responds to the animal's behaviour in real-time. Hence learning about these things in summer school would be of great help. 
Second, I can apply machine learning tools to analyse the vast amounts of data generated by the mice experiments. For example, I use DeepLabCut to automatically track the movements of mice in videos of their behaviour, allowing them to more accurately quantify their behavioural responses. I also use other machine learning tools to identify patterns in neural activity that correlate with specific behaviours, allowing them to gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making. These are some of the core techniques that the summer school specialises in and align with my current work.

Also, learning Arduino programming and 3D printing would help me design and monitor a reward delivery system to automatically deliver and manipulate reward (juice) rates and record the relevant data.

Finally, it would be an ideal place to draw inspiration from the diverse ideas and approaches presented at the school to inform my research. Many of the concepts or tools I would learn here about in the context of fruit fly phototaxis can be adapted to my research on mouse decision-making. Being exposed to new ideas and perspectives and broadening my understanding of the field would be interesting.

Overall, the skills and knowledge gained during the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School can help me to design and conduct more effective experiments, analyse data more accurately and efficiently, and draw on a wider range of ideas and approaches to inform my research.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* Here is a list of problems that I face on a good day during my experiment:
Technical failures: The system design might not work as expected, which leads to experimental failure. In most cases, we have huge trouble managing an automated reward delivery system to the rodents as well as tracking and monitoring their responses. We also have a hard time designing and developing custom-based cases to keep the head stage of the electrode intact without the mice's bodies. Overall, the experimental setup can be made more robust and automated, giving better data and saving a lot of time and manpower.
Electrode issues: Many other times, the electrodes might not record the signals properly.
Behavioural variability: Mice are known to display individual variability in their behaviour, which could make it difficult to interpret the results. Some mice might be more motivated to perform the task, while others might be less interested.
Data quality: The data quality could be affected by noise, interference, and movement artefacts. This could make it difficult to accurately analyze and interpret the results.

* One interesting area of research that could be pursued is the impact of environmental enrichment on brain plasticity and cognitive function. Environmental enrichment refers to the provision of a complex and stimulating environment for laboratory animals, which has been shown to increase neurogenesis, synaptic density, and cognitive abilities. This topic has important implications for both basic and applied neuroscience, as it may provide insights into the mechanisms of brain plasticity and how to promote cognitive health.
Regarding the project, I would suggest a multi-disciplinary approach involving researchers from different backgrounds, such as neuroscience, psychology, and engineering. The project could be divided into several aspects: experimental design, data analysis, and engineering.
The experimental design aspect could involve the design and implementation of environmental enrichment protocols for animals, as well as the development of behavioural assays to measure cognitive function. I would be involved in this part actively.
The data analysis aspect could involve developing and applying machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets generated by behavioural assays. I can assist experts in computational neuroscience and data analysis to do this. 
Finally, the engineering aspect could involve designing and constructing novel devices and equipment to enhance the environmental enrichment experience for animals. I would delegate this to the experts in bio-engineering and robotics to do this.

* The scientific literature shows that memory is a system dependent on the activity dynamic of different encephalic structures. For declarative memories, it is hypothesized that memory traces are stored temporarily in the hippocampus, but later, transferred and stabilized in associative neocortical regions. However, it is not well known how the communication between the hippocampus and neocortex occurs and how this process allows the transference and consolidation of memory traces. Furthermore, the molecular temporal dynamics and electrophysiological correlates of this process are still unknown.

Therefore, I am studying the molecular and electrophysiological temporal dynamics of spatial memory corticalization concerning the hippocampus (especially the CA1 region) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For this, I need an animal model and a behavioral test to evaluate spatial memory consolidation. I am using male Wistar rats as animal models and the Barnes Maze (BM) paradigm. For the BM, the animals are trained throughout 4 days (sessions), with 4 trials each day. Between the daily BM training sessions, the animals undergo a local field potential (LFP) recording during the animal’s sleep period, using the open-source acquisition system Open Ephys. Besides the LFP recording by using electrodes placed on CA1 and the mPFC, we also conduct accelerometer and video recordings. Another group of animals is also trained in the BM, but sacrificed at different time points (1: before the 1st day of training; 2: before the 2nd day of training; 3: after 4 days of training). The hippocampus and mPFC regions are extracted, their protein content concentrated, and a proteomics protocol is executed using an HPLC-MS/MS system. With the proteomics data, I aim to extract functional groups of proteins with altered abundance on CA1 and mPFC throughout the daily sessions, especially the ones classically associated with synaptic plasticity mechanisms.

Our laboratory is currently using Bonsai and Arduino to synchronize the LFP and video recordings, but we intend to implement a closed-loop system to disrupt the communication between the hippocampus and mPFC by electric/optogenetic stimulation when the animal reaches specific areas of the Barnes Maze. The objective is to produce a spatial memory impairment by not allowing these two regions to acquire or evoke information. Furthermore, I intend to use the DeepLabCut software to implement the pose estimation and overall behavioral analysis, but it is still being implemented. Therefore, attending the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School 2023 will be a great opportunity to learn how to better design and build a setup for the closed-loop experiments, and also how to implement the offline analysis using the DeepLabCut. Furthermore, I will be in contact with new tools, which will expand the possibilities for my current project and future ones.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The typical experimental problems I encounter usually relate to methods to search for temporal variations in electrophysiological and molecular parameters and their correlations with behavioral data. These differences are mainly attributed to manipulations, be they pharmacological or electrical stimulations on an animal’s brain, or just as a consequence of a process (e.g. memory consolidation) over time. 

Therefore, it is imperative to conduct the behavioral test adequately. It is also necessary to implement methods to estimate the animal’s pose and analyze its behavior while in a maze (e.g. Barnes Maze). To do that, a camera must be placed at the right spot, the video quality must be adequate for posterior analysis, and computers must be correctly set up for recording and video analysis. Additionally, regarding the electrophysiological recordings during sleep, it is important to synchronize the LFP and video recordings. To do that, the LFP recording system (Open Ephys) must be set along with the video recording. Later, the LFP recording system must continuously store a video frame counter or any temporal relevant information regarding the video. That way both recordings can be synchronized. To solve this problem, we used the Bonsai to record and count video frames, linked to an Arduino board, that sends a TTL pulse to the Open Ephys for every 10 frames. Consequently, it is possible to correlate behavioral data and electrical activity patterns.

* It is known that the communication between the hippocampus and cortical regions during sleep is imperative for the consolidation of declarative memories, especially spatial memories. However, there is no consensus in the scientific literature about the importance of mPFC memory representations on the consolidation of spatial memories. Therefore,  I would like to study the effects of inhibition of mPFC neural representations of a spatial memory. In special, I would like to show that by decoupling the communication between the hippocampus and the mPFC memory representations during events of sleep sharp-wave ripples (SWR), spatial memory is impaired. Furthermore, I would like to show that by inhibiting these cortical representations while the animal presents any kind of exploratory behavior during the Barnes Maze task, the spatial memory is also impaired.

For that, I would need TetTag-Cre mice. These animals would receive an AVV (carrying the ArchT opsin) infusion in the mPFC. There will be 3 groups: (1) one of them will be optogenetically stimulated after the real-time detection of sleep sharp-wave ripples; (2) the other will be stimulated while the animal presents exploratory behavior on BM; (3) the last one will be stimulated neither during sleep nor during the task. Furthermore, there will be AAV transfection control groups.

For the closed-loop experiments during the animal’s sleep period, I will need a setup to detect the sharp-wave ripples in real-time and trigger the stimulation. Furthermore, it is necessary to couple the event detection and a setup to allow the optogenetic stimulation itself. For the closed-loop experiments during the BM task, it is also important to have a setup to film the behavioral task and to detect the periods when the animal presents exploratory behavior.

I would prefer to build the electrophysiology/optogenetics and video recording/optogenetics setups, as well as the video offline analysis, considering the training of a machine learning algorithm to detect exploratory behavior. I would like to conduct electrophysiology and behavioral experiments as well. However, I would prefer to delegate the AAV infusion, electrode placement surgery, and control of mice strains to others.

* I am the staff scientist for the United States National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health Rodent Behavioral Core on the NIMH campus.  This means that I provide programming and project support for dozens of laboratories across the NIH campus (both NIMH and other NIH institutes).  Unlike many Core facilities, we do not run the experiments ourselves but provide (and create novel) equipment that we train others to use.

Although much of my job involves working with 3-D printed materials, Arduino, or code that either controls behavioral equipment or analyzes the results thereof, I'm entirely self-taught and have never taken a formal class in any of these technical skills.  While I can get the job done *eventually* (for instance, the Python exercises below took me FOREVER and a bit of Googling; I often know the structure of what I want to do but not the syntax), it is usually after a long stretch of trial and error where I make many novice mistakes.  I'm also certain that I have many bad habits of which I am unaware and that this sort of intense instruction would be helpful in remedying; one can only learn so efficiently from YouTube videos and StackOverflow!

Overall, my goals in attending would be twofold.  First, I hope to be more effective and efficient at my job.  Having a better grasp on these tools would both expand the possibilities of resources that I can provide to the entire NIH campus and make me faster and less error-prone so I can accomplish more each day.  Second, I hope to disseminate this knowledge to both my colleagues in the Core and all our users.  Part of my job is training others how to use our equipment so it would be my goal to teach this skills to the dozens of trainees that I work with each year.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* We often have users that want to synchronize, record from, and control disparate pieces of equipment.  This usually means:

1) Creating the apparatus, sometimes from scratch.  We often work with a machine shop for this purpose.
2) Write code to operate the apparatus.  This could be something like a Python/MATLAB script or, more frequently, uses Arduinos.
3) Write code to report and analyze the results.

As an example, a popular test in the facility is the looming threat task.  We use Bonsai to create the stimuli on a monitor and to track the animal in the enclosure.  When the animal enters an ROI, the looming stimulus is presented.  When our users also include optogenetics or fiberphotometry, we use Arduinos to control lasers or send synchronization pulses for important events to their equipment.

* I'd like to study manipulations of the consummatory vs. appetitive (i.e. eating vs. foraging) neurobiology of eating behavior.  This would likely involve both an operant reward scheme (touchscreen, running wheel, or lever press for food intake) as well as interconnected foraging vs. living spaces with monitoring equipment.

I'd enjoy the setup of the apparatus and developing the experimental design.  I'd enjoy figuring out how to best analyze the data, the literature review involved in such a project, and presenting the (hopefully interesting!) results to others.

I wouldn't enjoy writing up the paper (who does?) or the day-by-day execution of the animal study, especially any surgical procedures.  These are parts of the job that I've done hundreds or thousands of times and are just the boring parts.  That said, I feel like being a good collaborator means not pushing the boring parts onto other people so I'd always be happy to do my share!

* Animals in the wild, like rodents, face a constant struggle to find food, relying heavily on their sense of smell. Luckily, they've developed a savvy strategy, habituation to familiar odors. This helps them to detect and respond to novel odors that could be lifesaving. Despite much progress in describing habituation at the early sensory stages, it is at present poorly understood which (olfactory) regions are involved in habituation. In my project, I investigate which olfactory and neuromodulatory brain regions are involved in habituation by both recording and manipulating the regions of interest. I am currently investigating how the locus coeruleus (LC) facilitates olfactory habituation. As the primary source of noradrenaline (NE) in the brain, the LC has been linked to habituation. To achieve this, I am utilizing methods such as pharmacology to perform intracerebral muscimol infusions, and optogenetics to understand how LC's neuronal activity changes during repetitive olfactory presentations and its impact on mouse exploratory behavior. 
Utilizing different techniques like pharmacology, behavioral experiments, electrophysiology, I demonstrated that inhibiting the projection from a specific olfactory region to the olfactory bulb diminishes habituation. To determine if this manipulation is needed throughout the entire duration of the stimulus or just during the initial inhalation, I will conduct a closed-loop experiment. This will involve using Arduino to control the timing of optogenetic inhibition with high precision and Bonsai and Deeplabcut to record breathing and pupil dilatation behavior. As an advocate for open tools like Bonsai, I value the transparency and accessibility they offer for scientific research.

I must possess the distinct set of skills comprising basic electronics, Arduino, and Bonsai/Deeplabcut to conduct a closed-loop experiment that has the potential to provide indispensable insights into olfactory habituation. This experimentation will aid me in designing analogous experiments for my upcoming research. This combination of techniques in a closed-loop experiment has not been attempted in our lab before. My goal is to establish this technique and become independent in it, enabling me to pass along my knowledge with fellow PhD students. In conclusion, I recognize the need to attend the TBNSS summer school to gain the necessary skills, including analytical and interpretive skills in behavioral experiments, which are vital for conducting this research successfully. 

Collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds in a scientific project presents an opportunity to establish lasting connections and gain new perspectives beyond my lab. As a PhD representative, I highly value such collaborations, including those outside of my institution. The emphasis on data presentation and communication will aid me in effectively conveying my findings to the scientific community. 
I am confident that the school will improve my skills in using open-science tools and developing new approaches to study behavior. 
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* My recurring struggle with electronics expertise has been a significant obstacle in conducting experiments, forcing me to rely on established designs in our lab. While trying to modify a prewritten script from a colleague for optogenetic light stimulation via Arduino, I realized that my lack of confidence in electronics had hindered my ability to explore new experimental approaches. I now understand the importance of developing my electronics skills and seeking out opportunities to test and improve them in a collaborative and intellectually stimulating scientific community. 

I am currently looking to broaden my skillset by incorporating new tools such as Deeplabcut and Bonsai into my analysis of behavior. Despite using established in-house written scripts, individual differences in mouse experience, physiology, etc. result still in significant variability in my datasets after behavior analysis. This variability can make it challenging to draw clear conclusions or identify subtle effects, especially when sample sizes are small. To help address this issue, I recently began using Deeplabcut to track pupil dilation to standardize and quantify behavior more precisely across multiple trials and animals more easily. 
By combining multiple analysis tools, I hope to not only broaden my options beyond what is currently available in the lab and enhance data quality, but also gain the confidence to write my own analysis tools, which would be incredibly valuable for future research. Ultimately, I aim to expand my research perspectives and open new avenues for discovery by exploring and integrating a variety of techniques and tools to analyze behavior.

* As a PhD student in neuroscience researching habituation, I am intrigued by delving into this subject across various modalities and model organisms, specifically in terms of how human activity influences animal habituation behavior. My enthusiasm for biodiversity, which was fostered during my biology studies at university, drives me to explore this crossroads of ecology and neuroscience. During a Costa Rican conservation internship, I observed firsthand the impact of human activity on the environment, despite the country's efforts to protect wildlife. This experience has led me to consider studying animals that have been forced to habituate to novel environments due to human activity. The Costa Rican Robin provides a compelling example that has been habituated to urban noise, which forced them to sing at higher frequencies.  
I aim to study how deforestation impacts the migration patterns of certain species, like monarch butterflies. I will investigate their behavior and neural activity in olfactory and visual neurons in various novel environments. Studying how brain states change in different contexts, including deforestation and human activities, can deepen our understanding of neuronal plasticity and the limitations of neural computations in animals adapting to novel environments. I would like to collaborate with physiologists to measure hormone levels and other physiological parameters to study the role of brain-body interaction in this process.  
As a biologist and neuroscientist, my primary focus would be on developing and refining research questions that address fundamental queries about neural habituation and behavioral changes across changing environments. I would collaborate with statisticians to analyze data and prioritize working with engineering experts to optimize technological tools such as algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data collection and analysis. This experience will enable me to assess the feasibility of future research experiments to address specific questions. I would collaborate with ecologists and other field-specific researchers to design and implement experiments that provide a comprehensive understanding of how animals adapt to changing environments, while other field-specific researchers would handle data collection and pre-processing. Effective communication and outreach to diverse audiences, including policymakers and the public, will be crucial and will be done by project researchers and myself. This task division optimizes the project by utilizing the expertise of various scientists.

* Brain activity fluctuates daily between specific states, defined by the circuits active at the time. Two very well-defined states are sleep, characterized by the immobility of the animal, a reduction in sensory processing and variable brain activity depending on the sleep phase, and wakefulness, during which different behaviors are observed: exploration, grooming, feeding, resting. Given the close relationship between the movement and the state of the animal, in our project we propose to study the hypothesis of the existence of convergence between the circuits that control movements and those that control the sleep-wake cycle, focusing primarily on the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) of mice. In order to do this, we will use state-of-the-art techniques that allow evaluating the connection of specific subpopulations of the MLR with regions associated with the sleep-wake cycle, as well as measuring and manipulating their activity longitudinally, covering different states of the animal to assess their functionality. The results obtained will contribute to the basic knowledge about the circuital organization that allows the organized orchestration of brain activity and, in addition, to the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie debilitating symptoms associated with movement and sleep, such as those frequently observed in Parkinson's disease.
Considering the lack of courses in my university related to animal behavior in general, the Transatlantic Behavioural Neuroscience Summer School is a great and unique opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and gain skills about softwares and programming language typically used in behavioral neuroscience.
The Transatlantic Behavioural Neuroscience Summer School will give me insight and knowledge about tools that I have never got to fully learn, such as Python and Arduino, essential for experimental design and data analysis in behavioral neuroscience. Besides, our project requires animal video tracking along the sleep-wake cycle, so the combination of Python, Arduino and Bonsai turns out to be very helpful when trying to both capture and determine behavioral states in an autonomic way. In addition, the design and creation of 3D printed items is something that is usually delegated to other people in the lab, so learning how to do it will be very helpful in terms of self-reliance. Finally, using DeepLabCut with a different animal model than mice will further my knowledge about this tool.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The main problem that I face in my research is related to animal behavior tracking. A significant part of my project relies on being able to capture different behaviors during the wake state such as exploration, rearing, grooming, etc. through videos, classify those behaviors autonomically and synchronize them to neuronal activity so that we can eventually realize closed-loop experiments. We also need to do this during the animals’ sleeping hours, in order to detect slight changes that could occur in its typical resting state during sleep after neuronal manipulation. After the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School, I hope to have learned a whole new set of skills regarding mainly Bonsai and DeepLabCut that will surely help me carry out these tasks.

* Ever since I took interest in neuroscience I’ve been captivated by animal behavior. Nowadays I’m focused on sleep and motor control, and I haven’t defined quite yet what particular line of investigation I’d like to pursue afterwards. Additionally, my formation previous to my current PhD student status is in Ecology. Bearing this in mind, over these years my interest has been drawn to the study of the neural basis that underlie essential animal behaviors. Lately, I’ve been particularly interested in innate behaviors, such as predation or feeding, its phylogeny, what structures take part in the decision making previous and during the execution of said behavior, what happens at molecular, cellular, circuital level when innate behaviors are perfected, and so forth. Ideally, by the end of my PhD I will have a clearer idea about what to do next, for now it is sure that I will keep on studying different aspects of animal behavior, as broad as it is. In the meantime, I would like to learn as much as possible about experimental design, data analysis and theoretical background in behavioral neuroscience in order to be able to participate in every aspect of my future projects that I can. Nevertheless, knowing the reach and limits of my abilities, aspects that I would eventually delegate to others would be code writing in Python. Hopefully, future courses, workshops, schools, etc. that I attend will help me rethink this statement.

* I am currently in my second year of PhD at the University of Freiburg, Germany, working in the group of Dr. Julia Veit. My research focuses on investigating the mechanisms that guide inter-areal communication underlying contextual processing across mouse visual cortical areas. I am addressing this by performing multi-areal large-scale in-vivo electrophysiology (Neuropixels probes) combined with cell-type specific optogenetic perturbations in awake, head-fixed mice. The simultaneous recording of hundreds of neurons across different cortical layers in different regions at millisecond precision offers deep insights into neuron’s characteristics, functional connectivity across layers and across areas, and population-wide activity patterns induced by different visual stimuli. Additionally, I monitor the behavioural state of the animal by simultaneous recording of pupil dilation and locomotion data for all my sessions. The preliminary results of my PhD thesis were resented at Society for Neuroscience (SfN) meeting 2022 and at the 15th Göttingen meeting of German Neuroscience Society 2023.
So far my experiments have been passive experiments where different visual stimuli were displayed to the head-fixed mouse, moving forward I would like to implement visual discrimination tasks where animals can actively report different visual stimuli in a go/no-go task or during a choice paradigm task using a dual lickport setup. Performing my current experiments in a behavioural setup described above will help me investigate the effects of attention in inter-areal communication and in addition will also provide me with a robust behavioural readout for investigating mechanisms behind context discrimination in mice. To this end, I think the summer school would be a perfect place to get started on the basics of Arduino and Bonsai programming which would help me immensely in setting up this behavioural paradigm for my PhD thesis. If possible, I would also like to extend the approach to include closed-loop feedback to trigger cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations to gain deeper insights into causal mechanisms of inter-areal communications.     
For the most part, my analytical focus has been on estimating the spectral properties, coherence and granger causality between different brain regions in response to different visual stimuli and optogenetic perturbations. I have a large amount of pupil dilation data which are yet to be analysed, the summer school would also greatly benefit me in this aspect of the project as well.   
The topics covered in the summer school are highly relevant to my PhD project and additionally, this would be an excellent opportunity to network with leading experts in the field, thereby exceptionally benefiting my research and career prospects moving forward.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* I was the first PhD student at Dr. Julia Veit’s lab and had to establish Neuropixels recording and optogenetics from scratch. I came across multiple problems which over the course of time gave me an immense experience in troubleshooting and standardising protocols. Currently, my major experimental problem is with the in-vivo off-target effects of optogenetics. Both with the expression of opsins and in the network dynamics induced by optogenetic perturbation. Since I perform electrophysiology recordings from the optogenetically manipulated area and the downstream area I can clearly estimate the effects of optogenetic perturbation in source and target regions. Some examples include: (i) AAV1 and AAV9 have higher chances of anterogradely transporting the opsin to the postsynaptic neuron, this I realised from the histology and also from in-vivo activity; where this could also be wrongly interpreted as entrainment of target neurons by source neurons while in reality it's just the transport of opsins and spread of light inducing optogenetic stimulation of postsynaptic neurons. (ii) Red light alone can induce neural activity even in non-opsin-injected animals. (iii) Inhibiting PV-interneurons has multiple off-target effects.

* I would like to team up with other labs working on similar brain regions or having similar experimental tasks. For example: (i) groups working on V1 or (ii) groups working with similar visual stimuli but are interested in different brain regions such as superior colliculus or higher visual areas etc.
In the first case, I would like to partner with groups working on the same brain region but have expertise in different experimental techniques - a lab with high patching experience, a lab with extracellular electrophysiology, one with 2P imaging systems, one with expertise in molecular and transcriptomic techniques and a computational neuroscience lab. I would gladly help with the extracellular electrophysiology part. Each technique has its speciality and weakness as well, this was we can put to use the best available technologies together to address one big picture question in different ways, eg. patching could provide single neuron properties, extracellular electrophysiology for large-scale network dynamics with high temporal resolution (Spikes + LFP (for oscillation studies)), 2P imaging for large-scale cell-type specific dynamics with higher spatial resolution and cellular identity, potentially also combined with imaging novel fluorescent sensors to gain insights on neurotransmitter dynamics etc.   
Together we can decide on a topic to work on and settle down with the specifics of the experiment that can be done across labs and one that would be logically feasible to put together to gain valuable insights. For example: Investigating the causal role of a particular interneuron cell type across different contexts, or the role of different interneuron subtypes belonging to a particular class of interneurons etc. And the computational group could potentially incorporate all the gathered data into a novel mathematical network model that could explain the functional network connectivity.

* Yes, I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver. If selected for the summer school, my lab would be able to cover my commuting expenses.
Dr. Julia Veit’s lab is a newly established non-tenured junior research group. As a junior research group, we have limited funding availability for conferences and summer schools. The restricted travel budget must cover the travel expenses of all members of the group for 6 years. Hence, I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver. Any external stipend or scholarship would allow me to use our group’s limited funding for presenting my work at conferences such as SfN, FENS, COSYNE etc. in the coming years which would greatly help me in enhancing the quality and impact of my research work.
Attending the summer school would not only provide me with valuable knowledge and novel ideas but also help me in transferring the knowledge to all my current and future colleagues. I would be immensely grateful if you could kindly consider my application favourably.

* My research project aims to study the visual perception of crabs (Neohelice granulata and Leptuca uruguayensis), particularly their polarization vision compared to their perception of different contrasts in intensity. One of the key focuses of the project is at the behavioral level, where the animals are placed on a spherical treadmill and presented with different stimuli that vary both in the intensity of light and in their degree of polarization.

The knowledge that I could gain from this course would be essential for me to develop different paradigms when designing behavioral experiments (ways to approach the study of a certain variable, creation of experimental arenas, etc.). This is primarily important for me to be able to create my own experiments since the area of study in which I am working requires a high level of customization.

In these experiments, a wide range of behaviors are identified, from escape response, claw retraction, freezing, and attacks. So far, I can measure the escape response quantitatively, but the rest of the variables are studied only qualitatively. The use of DeepLabCut would also be of great help to cover these instrumental deficiencies.

Regarding data analysis, I use a trajectory reconstruction program called FicTrac, as well as Python to synchronize the appearance of the stimulus in the videos obtained by using LED light. In this sense, learning both Bonsai and Arduino would be an important addition to my repertoire of behavioral tools.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the laboratory has several members and the knowledge gained in this course would be shared with the rest of the team as well as passed on to the next generations who join the team.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One of the typical problems I face when embarking on a new experiment is finding a way to design a protocol that leads us to answer the question we have. This is due to the lack of tools to create a good experimental arena, as well as the lack of experience in setting up a setup that meets our needs without restricting the behaviors of the crabs. These details are extremely important to evoke as smooth a response as possible.

Once this issue is solved, data analysis tools often present obstacles. For example, the program we use (FicTrac) does not always interpret the animal's movements in the right way, and the analysis of behaviors is often exhaustive as it must be done at a qualitative level by observing each of the experimental trials. These aspects of post-analysis could see improvements in their effectiveness with the incorporation of programs such as Bonsai and Arduino.

* I would love to study the behavior of different groups of arachnids, more precisely the ones of sanitary relevance in the country where I come from, Argentina (the important genera being Latrodectus, Loxoceles, and mainly Phoneutria). I would like to design experiments that help us elucidate the level of aggressiveness these animals handle, as well as their hunting habits and behavior, in order to contribute to the construction of knowledge and help us coexist better with these animals, minimizing the harm they can cause us and we can cause them.

The parts of the project I would like to be involved in would be designing and setting up the experiments, as well as field trips for obtaining raw data. I would perhaps delegate the aspects related to designing the data analysis, without disregarding the importance of reviewing and working on them with peers and superiors.

* Our research team is based in Argentina, at the University of Buenos Aires, and unfortunately, we are facing some financial constraints at the moment. The lab where I am pursuing my PhD does not have sufficient funds to cover the costs of attending scientific conferences or training courses. While we do receive some support from our local institution (the University of Buenos Aires), this funding is mainly allocated to cover expenses related to daily lab operations, animal care, and research activities. Therefore, I am looking for external funding opportunities, such as grants, that could potentially allow me to attend your course. I believe that the knowledge and skills that I would gain from this course would greatly benefit my academic and professional development, as well as contribute to our research team's work.

* My research project aims to understand how an animal extremely different from us perceives its visual environment. Specifically, I work with triatomines, which are nocturnal bugs of sanitary importance, as they are vectors of Chagas disease in Latin America.
I am trying to understand when vision is a relevant sensory input for triatomines, and at the same time, what their visual capabilities are. In this regard, behavior is a key approach. Therefore, it is common in my daily laboratory work to design my own experimental devices. Currently, I am working with a behavioral paradigm of escape response to looming visual stimuli. This approach involves learning how to use and fine-tune a number of open-source technologies, such as FicTrac, a software that allows for the reconstruction of animal trajectories on a spherical treadmill, Bonsai, which I use to program visual stimuli and also for the subsequent video analysis, and Arduino, which I use both to control ambient light and to synchronize stimuli with the lighting of a LED.
I believe that the knowledge I will gain from this course will help me to deepen and improve the implementations of all this technology in my work, and will give me new insights into what other experimental approaches are available. For example, I am really interested in knowing how to use DeepLabCut, as I would like to use it for registering different body movements of bugs during its escape response when faced to looming stimuli. I would also like to learn how to design and control closed-loop experiments, because these are essential for studying visual perception. So I believe that the intensive work at the school will boost my skills in design and analysis of different behavioural experiments, and will let me transmit all this knowledge to my research group. Science in Argentina is a challenge in terms of budget, so learning how to use these tools helps a lot to close the gap with more developed countries.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* Maybe the most typical problem I encounter in my research is deciding to improve the recording or the analysis of data but being unable to progress because of lack of sufficient documentation and lack of people who have expertise on that. This becomes really frustrating as it creates a significant obstacle when trying to understand the intricacies of software without a well-guided introduction to it. I often encounter this issue when dealing with problems such as statistical analyses of my data. This is why I found the transatlantic school so relevant, as it allows for face-to-face interaction between instructors and students to tackle various experimental challenges together.

* I was always interested in studying animal behaviour in natural habitats. It represents a huge challenge as it is difficult to control experimental conditions, but it gives a more realistic approach on how animals react to environmental stimuli and, in consequence, provides us evidence about how they perceive. With this aim (typical of sensory ecology), I would like to study host seeking behaviour of dipterans mediated by audition. It has always fascinated me the different hearing strategies that insects have developed, and antennal hearing in particular results more attracting to me as there is limited knowledge about it. One typical approach of this topic is carrying out field phonotaxis experiments, which implies recording behaviour at these animals’ natural habitat. In this context, I would like to be in charge of the design of the electronical devices necessary to carry out the experiment in the field, as well as the programming of the auditory stimuli to be playbacked to the insects. That involves recording host vocalizations (i.e. frogs) in the field and preparing the recordings to posterior presentations.
I would delegate to my colleagues the execution of field experiments as well as the processing of raw data for subsequent statistical analysis.

* Our research group is based in Argentina, at the University of Buenos Aires, and our funding situation is far from being optimal. Currently, the laboratory where I’m doing my Doctorate does not count with enough funds to cover the payment of registration fees to assist to scientific meetings or courses. Although we have local institution economic support (University of Buenos Aires), this is mostly intended for daily laboratory supplies, animal rearing and experimentation. Thus, a grant is the only way that could allow me to assist your course. Considering the benefits that the know-how provided by the course will bring to me and my research group, it would be an enormous contribution to my Doctorate and academic formation.

* Ghrelin is a peptide hormone involved in energy homeostasis, rewarding and stress process. It acts thought its unique receptor growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of the Cannabis plant. Given that numerous evidence show that ghrelin accentuates the capacity of various psychoactive substances to act in the brain, I am aimed to investigate the neuroanatomical and molecular mechanisms by which THC acts in the brain through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and their cross talk with endogenous ghrelin system. We have already evaluated some behavioral effects of central THC treatment in wild type male mice (locomotor activity, conditioned place preference and food intake). Currently I am exploring the neuroanatomical co-distribution of CB1R and GHSR. Gaining insights about the simultaneous distribution of both GPCRs is crucial to clarify the extent of this putative interaction between these systems. The next step in my research project is to evaluate behavioral aspects associated with cellular processes involving the nuclei where we have found co-distribution of GHSR and CB1R to establish a likely physiological consequence of this GPCRs distribution in the mouse brain. Learning about electronics, 3D printing, Arduino, Bonsai, design of behavioral experiments and data analysis at the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School will be definitely useful for my PhD thesis. I am very excited to hear from expert researchers in the field and to learn about novel techniques. Especially, attending to the different symposia will broaden my perspective and help me to have a global understanding of behavioral neuroscience in different experimental models.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The main experimental problem that I usually meet in my research is the analysis of the data obtained and the use of them to obtain a greater volume and quality of information. Particularly, to measure locomotor activity (LA) and conditioned place preference or aversion (CPP/CPA) we use Fiji software, which has allowed us, by writing macros, to obtain information regarding other behaviors such as rearing, digging, still and grooming from the recording of the videos obtained in the LA or CPP tests. I can use these tools, but I am limited when it comes to writing macros that respond to specific needs and facilitate the analysis of my data. Something similar happens to me when analyzing microscopy images, I feel the growing need to learn how to handle software that allows me to solve specific questions to obtain results from the data. In summary, my biggest problem is that I do not have the necessary tools to optimize the analysis of my data, I am behind with respect to the recent explosion of new software tools that favor the generation of knowledge

* If I had enough funding, time and could choose the people with whom to collaborate, I would love to approach a THC delivery model closer to human consumption patterns to apply in my experimental designs. It is demonstrated that there are relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics and accumulation of THC and metabolites depending on the administration route, so appropriately modelling the route of administration in pre-clinical studies is cue. Vaped, oral or edible intake of cannabis is one of the most popular forms of consumption in humans, and so this is a main interest to me. So far we have only been able to experiment the central route of administration in mice, mainly because the volumes of reagent needed are minimum, this is important considering the low budget available for my project and the current legislative framework for the regular purchase of THC in Argentina. I would look at the opportunity to work together with some group from Canada, Israel or Italy,  pioneer in cannabis legislation and health research countries. 
My undergraduate background is biochemistry, going one step further in my imagination, I would definitely love to be part of a research project that includes clinical studies in humans, hopefully in my country. In any case, I would prefer to delegate the bureaucratic part of the project to others (e.g. getting funding and legal approvals), and I would focus on the experiments design and execution.

* I am form Argentina, it is known that Latin American countries (except for Brazil) spend less than 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) on research and development, well below the average of 2–3% of GDP for developed nations (doi: 10.1080/15216540701258751). Among other things, this affects our ability to attend international conferences and courses. Particularly, the IMBICE neurophysiology lab group where I work, doesn’t have founding available to pay 450 €, that is why I need financial support to cover the school fee.

* I'm currently in the process of starting my own independent group, on which I'd like to study the interaction between diet, circadian rhythms and sleep regulation using Drosophila. To do so, I intend to combine behavioral characterizations with the manipulation of neuronal activity.  One of the projects I think will be extremely related to the school topics are: studying the interplay between behaviors associated to reproductive drives (courting, egg laying, etc), sleep (which in Drosophila is assessed by behavioral definitions) and the nutritional context the flies have access to. While I have several years of experience with the analysis of Drosophila activity detected by simple IR-crossing devices (DAM monitors), the projects I intend to pursue will require a far more detailed description of the animals’ behaviors, since we will need to describe exactly what the animal is doing when it is not sleeping. This will include the building of behavioral arenas -including some with automatic chamber movements-, building devices which will allow for timed optogenetic manipulation, as well as the analysis of long-term video recordings of animals' behavior. These aims will benefit from topics covered in the course such as 3D printing, controlled stimuli applications, and IA-assisted behavior tracking. I think being able to attend this course will be a game-changer for my group and my career. It would make it possible both for me to transfer this knowledge to future lab members, as well as to being able to provide better support and mentorship to those students who are already familiar with the topics covered by the course. In addition, attending the school will be a unique opportunity to build new connections with other researchers in the field, helping boost our new group and expanding the network of behavioral research.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* There are two problems I face in my current research: the ability to quantify a variety of Drosophila behaviors (motion, egg laying, feeding, courting, etc) on long-terms recordings (>24 hours) that include both a Light and Dark (IR light) phases. On the other hand, we are working on devices that allow for automatic changes in the access of the flies to the food, in order to have the animals in different timed-restricted feeding paradigms. The topics and tools covered by the course will be of invaluable help for overcoming these challenges.

* As a personal activity I’ve been involved in organizations that work hand and hand with rural communities of Argentina, that suffer the impacts of extensive pesticide use. The impact comes not only from uncontrolled air applications, but also through water contamination by malpractices in the disposal of pesticides leftovers. I would love to have the time and resources to bring the power of Drosophila behavior and genetics into helping to diagnose the consequences of pesticide use. I think the model could help, for example, as a biosensor by having a standardized protocol that helps measure toxicity effects from different water sources. I think this needs to be combined with a strong cooperation with the communities, and it would include the work of not only biomed scientists, but also of colleagues from social sciences. I’d love to work both on the setting up of the protocols and testing the possible sensor system, as well as on establishing ties with the affected communities. The part I would probably be less enthusiastic about will be any regulatory/bureaucratic-related issue associated with running such a project.

* “Success in life is not what you study, it is what you feel, what you are passionate about”. One day I was in a class and my professor told us this phrase, and I felt identified and made it mine. When I am in the laboratory, in front of a stereo microscope, I feel it is my place in the world. 
My name is Agustina Bruno-Vignolo, and I am a geneticist in the second year of my PhD program. I strongly believe that attending this course would greatly benefit my career in multiple ways. For almost two years, I have been working at the Neurobiology of Sleep lab at IBioBA-CONICET-MPSP, under the guidance of Dr. Nara I. Muraro, pursuing a research line that aims to describe the role of the ClC-a channel in Drosophila neuronal circuits that regulate sleep/wake behavior. As a geneticist, I have gained extensive research experience in conducting behavioral experiments and image analysis, while also developing my critical thinking skills. In the upcoming months, I am excited to learn how to perform whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, a technique that will provide our investigation with a new approach and enable us to delve even deeper into the mechanisms that regulate sleep/wake behavior.
The Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School could make a great environment for me to connect with students from different places and research interests in the field of neuroscience, which I believe is fundamental both for the beginning of my scientific career as well as my personal growth. Moreover, I consider essential to be updated in the state-of-the-art methods and ideas that go one step forward in the study of neuroscience and biomedical research. 
Finally, I deem myself passionate about my biological model and the study of behavior in general, and I truly believe that this opportunity will provide me the tools for understanding better my future research, as well as to be able to improve myself as a young neuroscientist and make a contribution to the progress of the Drosophila scientific community of my country.

* Sleep is a complex behavior that presents challenges for researchers attempting to measure it, particularly in the case of Drosophila. One commonly used tool for measuring sleep in fruit flies is the Drosophila Activity Monitors (DAMs), which allows to infer sleep based on changes in activity levels. However, this approach has limitations, as it usually overestimates the levels of sleep. Another challenge with using DAMs to measure sleep in Drosophila is that they do not allow the distinction between different sleep stages, which can be important for understanding the quality of sleep. 
Alternative tools, such as the recently developed Ethoscopes, offer a more sophisticated means of measuring sleep in Drosophila, as they can distinguish between different micromovements, or evidence activities such as feeding or egg laying. However, these tools require more complex technology and may not be readily available in many research laboratories.
In light of these challenges, it would be beneficial to develop a more precise and easy-to-use technology for quantifying sleep in Drosophila, particularly in labs that are accustomed to using the DAMs. This would allow researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the sleep patterns and behaviors of Drosophila, which could ultimately lead to better insights into the biology of sleep.

* As I specified earlier, I am passionate about both my biological model and the study of behavior. If given the opportunity to work on any topic with enough time and resources, I would like to elucidate the genetic bases that govern certain behaviors, as well as the differences that make each individual a unique being. In particular, focusing on the study of sleep in Drosophila, I would like to be able to design a tool that allows us to measure and quantify this behavior in a much more precise manner. The challenges we face in the field, due to the small size of the fly's brain compared to mammals, which can undergo electroencephalograms, for example, limit us in the interpretation of results. With a more detailed study and the wide variety of genetic tools at our disposal, I am confident that we could get a little closer to the answer to the big question that concerns us: why do we sleep? Although I recognize my limitations in terms of complex electronic designs and programming, I would like to learn and contribute in any way possible to our understanding of the brain and behavior.

* Nowadays science is severely underfunded in my country and inflation and the devaluation of the national currency have made local research grants look pitiful in the face of the growing cost of equipment and reagents. Despite these obstacles, I remain deeply committed to advancing our understanding of the brain and behavior. One advantage is that I already reside in the city of Buenos Aires, which means that I would only need funding to cover the cost of the course fee.

* The object location task (OLT) is used for spatial learning in rodents, and has been helpful to understand sleep-dependent memory formation processes. For instance, it has been shown in mice that suppression of hippocampal theta rhythm during REM sleep impairs the performance in OLT and manipulation of oscillatory coupling in NREM sleep improves the performance in rats. The Barnes Maze is another spatial learning task widely used in memory related studies, however not as frequently used in sleep-dependent memory research. In my master’s project, we are interested in testing whether the intrinsic variability between subjects commonly observed in OLT’s and BMs performance correlates with sleep architecture and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex oscillatory coupling. In the future, we intend to use closed loop approaches to understand possible causalities between sleep events and the OLT and BMs performance.

In order to evaluate this, we implant electrodes in the prefrontal-cortex and hippocampus of Wistar rats. After recovery, animals undergo the OLT protocol and the BM protocol, both of them followed by post-task electrophysiological sleep recording. Recordings are made using Open Ephys software and videos are recorded using Bonsai. Both are coupled with an Arduino in charge of synchronizing video and LFP. In our lab, the results currently are analyzed using Matlab and DeepLabCut.

This summer school will contribute greatly not only for the analysis of our current data, but also put us abreast of modern solutions for behavioral and electrophysiology-related problems. Especially when it comes to data analysis, Python and Bonsai are open-source platforms that reduce bias and encourage science reproducibility, which brings more quality and credibility to findings. This school would also be my first contact with 3D printing, which will contribute to the development of better and personalized material for electrode implantation. Seeing as to how limited my knowledge of some of the techniques presented in this course is, this will be an opportunity to broaden my perspectives of the possibilities in the sleep and memory field.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One of the biggest experimental problems we’ve recently met was trying to reproduce behavioral data acquired in other labs. We’ve come to the conclusion that determining meaningful behavioral parameters to quantify behavioral tasks and analyzing with minimum human error is still a challenge in our field. Furthermore, when it comes do local field potential analysis, functions traditionally used still are somewhat arbitrary and not well descripted in many papers, so reproducing results obtained by other laboratories is another challenge. Specifically in our facility, we also have a limited computational capacity to run some analysis, such as converting big Open Ephys data or running some Matlab scripts, so understanding modern tools would help us overcome this limitation.

* In the sleep and memory field, optogenetics and closed loop approaches are really modern and precise techniques that enable sleep intervention. In this manner, a side project that would be of great interest would be to intervene in NREM or REM sleep oscillatory coupling in different brain regions and evaluate how it influences memory formation. For instance, I would greatly like to understand the role of tonic and phasic REM in memory formation.

In order to do this, animals would undergo a viral vector infusion surgery to transfect neurons with the desired light sensitive ion channel. I’m not yet familiar with this technique, and it might be necessary to delegate to others, at least until I learn how to successfully transfect the area of interest. Next, animals would go through an electrode implantation surgery, as well as LED implantation in the area of optogenetics intervention. After animals recover, LFP recordings of behavioral tasks and subsequent sleep would be made. In this case, it would be necessary the technological infrastructure, for example an automatic and real-time sleep detection system, and also a detection mechanism for the intervention of the desired oscillatory event. Also, these would have to be synchronized with the electronic part needed for LED activation. This is one aspect of the project I would like to be capable of producing myself, along with the necessary devices and circuitry installation for optogenetics and LFP recording, but I would need help of people with more experience in electronics. Another part I would like to be able to do myself is analyzing and understanding the acquired data. Specially when it comes to different types of REM, it would be necessary high precision and specific knowledge to separate tonic and phasic phases. Finally, an essential part would be the behavioral aspect. After animals undergo specific memory tasks, it is necessary to evaluate its performance. To optimize this, machine learning techniques would be applied to quantify different patterns. I have no experience in machine learning, and although I would probably have to delegate this to others, I would like to understand the necessary steps.

* My aim is to complete my undergraduate degree and then go on to do a PhD researching the perspective that neuroscience can give on psychoactive substances, my interests vary along the multiple effects of these substances and how they alter interactions between subjects. 
In particular, I would like to gain a better understanding of how behaviour is affected by these substances. 
For example, MDMA users in electronic parties tend to report experiences of 'feeling good', 'being in touch with others', 'being in the moment', they express that their sense of empathy is enhanced and they report that they feel more 'alive'. 
Another example would be the classic experiment where a group of rats are offered cocaine and they take it until they become addicted, but they don't if they share an environment with their peers, a place where they can socialise.
In another hand There is evidence that connections between regions of the brain are altered For other substances, such as LSD or psilocybin, there is evidence that connections between regions of the brain are altered in psychedelic experiences, there is theories like the 'entropic brain', that link the understanding of altered states of consciousness and psychedelics,  suggesting that there's still much to be discovered in the field of psychoactive and psychedelics substances with the help of neuroimaging research. 
I think that attending this school could help me to define what I want to do as a scientist in the field of substance use, abuse and the relationship that you can have with others. 
The 'connection' levels of MDMA users can be related to aspects of good human relationships and I would like to discover what research in this area can do for us. 
While MDMA would enhance these feelings, the social group can be fundamental in preventing cocaine abuse.

* As long as I'm a student, I haven't done the experiments that I would like to do, but let's imagine a hypothetical situation where I want to see the effects of substances. I think that the usual problem I would face could be the legal problem, as long as these substances are really hard to get in Argentina and it is hard to get the permissions you would need to do experiments with people and substances, I found that doing research on animals could be a way to solve it, with the limitations that this turn could have. 
Other problems might be the conclusions that are drawn from the subjective experiences and the objective findings, where these difficulties in mixing the results can be hard to solve (maybe they will never be solved) I think that can be the richest and deepest answers that we can have.
Also, there is a social tendencie to think that substances may stay illegal or thinking that users are the ones doing wrong things, illegal, and morally incorrect.

* From an abstract point of view, I would try to do a study where I could work on a mixed technique (cualitative and cuantitative) trying to get subjective reports from people who use the substances mentioned before and add the objective perspective with the resources of neuroimaging (fMRI) to specify the nature of substance use for recreational purposes, as well as for abuse and addiction. 
I think this is important because there are millions of people who use (or abuse) substances and the effects of this are unknown in the vast majority of cases... well, I have to say that there is progress and there are scientists who want to work in this field, such as Carhart Harris or Enzo Tagliazucci and his team, if we are talking about the national level.

* My project focuses on the study of the double burden of malnutrition and its effects on neurodevelopment, how it affects behavior and its implications for metabolism.
Malnutrition comprises two groups of conditions. On one side, there is malnutrition, which includes delayed growth (height less than that which corresponds to age), emaciation (weight less than that which corresponds to height), underweight (weight less than that which corresponds to age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (lack of important vitamins and minerals). On the other hand are overweight and obesity, which are related to different non-communicable diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer).
In many developing countries, infants can suffer from malnutrition and consequent insufficient growth, followed later by overweight or obesity due to the subsequent consumption of caloric foods such as carbohydrates, fats, etc. This phenomenon is known as the double burden of malnutrition, and it is a phenomenon that is expanding especially in low- and medium-income countries, regions, and neighborhoods.
Finally, individuals suffering from malnutrition are often exposed to different forms of stress. In particular, social stress is frequently observed in overcrowded situations, linked to the coexistence of different generations in reduced environments and in unfavorable social, environmental and economic contexts. Child abuse, defined as any act of the adult in charge that by action or omission causes harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to the child, has intense and harmful neurobiological and neuroendocrine consequences, affecting the child's development in both behavioral and emotional aspects. , social and cognitive as well as physical.
To date, there is no animal model to study the consequences of the double burden of malnutrition. The general objective of this project is to develop a double burden model of malnutrition in young mice and to evaluate its long-term consequences on the central nervous system, as well as its interaction with social stress.
Regarding what the course can contribute to my knowledge to apply in my project, tools such as bonsai or DLC are extremely important since the vast majority of my experiments are behavioral, in addition to being able to see how to work with another model animal will help me to expand my knowledge and see from another angle how to deal with different problems

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* 
Most of the problems are with the statistical analysis of the results since I don't have enough knowledge to understand if what I'm doing is correct or not. Also there are also usually problems with the tracking of the animals in the behavioral tests, since many of these are not automated. On the other hand sometimes we have supply problems and lack of own equipment and space because we share the equipment with another groups  and that does not allow us to do the experiments fast enough or in time as I would like.

* I would like to measure the role of the mesolimbic system and the microglia and how involved it is with food intake and addiction to the food, because It is known that the nucleus accumbens projects to the lateral hypothalamus and this is involved in the control of ingestion, using techniques like optogenetic to modulate this activity in dopaminergic neurons, conducting behavioral tests that allow me to observe how eating is affected based on neuronal activity, such as the suppressed feeding test, and also evaluate the state of inflammation in that areas . 
What I would do would be the experimental part, set-up of the experiment, the behavioral tests and the corresponding surgeries, thus delegating the part of the statistical analysis

* I am currently starting the third year of my PhD and I have already come a long way in my current project. I believe the past two years have been thoroughly formative both in the theoretical framework of my field of study (Circuit Neuroscience) and in the experimental training required to carry out my projects autonomously. Now, I am looking forward to acquiring new, cutting edge knowledge of neuroscience techniques so I can bring a new approach to my project, and diversify the ways I tackle my experimental questions about what mice can tell us about the anatomy, pathophysiology and early origins of psychiatric disorders.
My project involves finding the neural substrate of the anxious and depressive-like phenotypes evidenced in a mice model of early-life stress. We seek to uncover what neuroanatomical and physiological changes take place during early postnatal development that can influence and shape the adult emotional responses. We combine confocal microscopy with fluorescent immunolabeling to reveal changes in the synaptic microstructure of the prefrontal cortex to dorsal raphe nucleus neuronal circuit, which is key to stress responses and mood control. Then we analyze the behavioral phenotype and how it can be altered by modulation of the serotonergic system. Furthermore it is known that different neuronal pathways arising from the prefrontal cortex, can elicit different, opposite behavioral outputs regarding despair behavior. Whereas one path promotes active stress-coping, the other elicits depressive-like behavior. In addition, behavioral output may also be modulated by the firing pattern of pyramidal glutamatergic neurons. Finally, adding one more layer of complexity, the dorsal raphe is also divided into different topographically-mapped functional regions, and different behavioral outputs might be elicited depending on with region is contacted by the cortex. So, to summarize, this reciprocal synaptic circuit is key in the modulation of emotional and stress-related behavior, and it requires a complex technical approach to be properly studied. I would love to be able to learn how to perform closed-loop experiments, and design my own experimental setup in such a way that I am able to detect fast changes or alternations in complex behaviors, which, combined with optogenetics or DREADDs can allow me to manipulate neural activity while simultaneously registering the live behavioral output. For this I would need to acquire the expertise to use tools like behavioral segmentation and analysis, and arduino use (both hardware and software) in order to design the setup, since my lab does not currently perform this kind of experiments. This course would provide an unique opportunity to acquire personalized, hands-on experience with these tools that will be imprescindible to make my own design in the near future.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The typical problem I encounter is currently not a technical issue per se, but more of a limitation of the conclusions I can draw from my data. I am thrilled by my PhD project, and right now I am working on the characterization of my mice model of early stress from an static point of view, since I have conducted confocal microscopy combined with immunofluorescence to reveal developmental synaptic alterations in my circuit of interest. These studies provide me key information about altered neuroanatomy, but I really think this should be the angular stone on which I should build the rest of the project on, and that should include in vivo analysis of complex behavior and neural activity of the cell populations studied. Here I encounter a technical-wall because I do not master the use of the tools necessary to perform and set up these experiments, but if I did manage to learn them, I am positive my PhD supervisor will allow me to implement them in our research and I think it would be a most valuable addition.

* I would like to be part of a team devoted to developing new behavioral tests for evaluation of emotional responses in rodent models. I believe there is more complex behavior to be analyzed than just forced swim/tail suspension test or sucrose preference test in order to assess depressive-like behavior. This can only be possible as part of a team, and must be an orchestrated effort, because it is only valuable if enough scientists in the field are willing to try and apply it. I would like to be in charge of the design of the arenas and experimental setups, and would try to automate every step possible using cutting edge technologies. I would probably prefer to delegate the task of validating the test, meaning, the part where you need to contrast every automatic analysis with a human experimented scorer, but I wouldn't mind doing it myself if that means the existence of a new behavioral task to test emotional behavior. Since I would like to test higher order function, likely modulated by the prefrontal cortex, I would like this setups to have a closed-loop design so that we could see the mouse real-time responses to provoked stimulation with optogenetics or fiber photometry.
In a different field, a little further from my current studies, I would love to disentangle the inner workings of the gut-brain axis. How the gut microbiota can affect so many different aspects of human health is really intriguing, and even more intriguing would be trying to come up with ways to tackle different diseases from a different approach: through the microbiome. In this project I would probably delegate the purely microbiological aspects of the study, such as cell-cultures and in vitro experiments, and I would rather tackle the part where we extrapolate the findings to mice models in order to check different hypothesis, take samples, or analyze the effects of different interventions. I am most intrigued by dissecting what is the mechanism behind the information exchange between the two regions, how it is coded, and where it is processed in the brain nuclei.

* Currently, I am in my third year of my PhD, working on a project that aims to investigate the impact of neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine and serotonin, on the hippocampal neuronal response to spatial and sensory stimuli. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory formation and spatial codification in mammals, and I am interested in studying how neuromodulators alter local circuit dynamics and affect behavior and learning. To do this, I use various cell labeling strategies and perform electrophysiological recordings in acute slices of mice hippocampus. 

One of the most exciting parts of my project involves studying how changes in local circuits produced by acetylcholine affect behavior and learning. I use a GO/NO GO virtual discrimination task with transgenic mice and a DREADDs approach to induce acetylcholine release while the animals learn the task. This involves a setup that provides visual stimuli, records behavioral information, and allows for extracellular recordings while the animals behave. Although I find this part of my project extremely challenging, I am eager to learn more about it, including how the Arduino-based setup works and how to control it. 

The TBNSS course presents an excellent opportunity for me to expand my knowledge in several areas. Since the behavioral setup in my lab was already assembled and configured, I have only learned to be a user and do not fully understand how it works. Therefore, I believe that this course will provide me with the chance to become more familiar with electronics and software programming for these setups. Moreover, as we plan to incorporate a camera to track the licking GO response, I am confident that the DeepLabCut and behavioral analysis modules of the course will be valuable additions to my toolkit. 

Overall, I am enthusiastic about the TBNSS and the potential it holds for advancing my research and career. I am committed to making the most of the tools and theoretical frameworks the course offers and applying them to my research. 
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* During my electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, I encounter various challenges due to the complex nature of the procedure. However, one recurring issue is the presence of unwanted noise. Although I find it challenging, I am learning different solutions from my colleagues to mitigate this issue. 

In contrast, the behavioral part of my project presents fewer difficulties. However, a frequent issue that arises is the occasional error of our microcontroller and data acquisition system, Bpod. When this happens, the behavioral task training is interrupted, and I am left feeling frustrated. While I can troubleshoot some of these errors, there are times when I struggle to comprehend how the system works, leading to longer interruptions in the experiments.

* If I had sufficient funding and unlimited time, I would love to explore innovative ways to minimize waste from laboratory research contaminants. Upon entering academia, I was surprised by the excessive use of one-time plastic materials in research, which inevitably end up in landfills due to the absence of ecological alternatives or recycling policies. While plastic gloves and tips are undoubtedly useful in maintaining a sterile environment, they contradict the scientific community's stance on climate change. 

Therefore, I would like to investigate alternative materials for glove fabrication that can promote circularity and be beneficial for laboratory practices. As part of this endeavor, I would take charge of testing prototypes and assessing their effectiveness in various laboratory applications. I aim to collaborate with researchers specializing in material’s science to develop and test the feasibility of different glove designs. Additionally, I would like to work with individuals knowledgeable about product circularity and recycling options for the gloves' end-of-life. Ultimately, I believe that a diverse range of perspectives and backgrounds could foster optimal experimentation, so I would like to brainstorm and collaborate with all involved parties.

* Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. It is classically associated with neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway generating motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia and basal tremor. However, evidence shows that the disease is associated with alterations in multiple nuclei in the central nervous system. Such changes appear to underlie the various non-motor symptoms (NMS), such as sleep impairment, deficits in frontal functions, social interaction problems, and psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Our laboratory is interested in testing the hypothesis that brain oscillations abnormalities during sleep may be underlying the emotional and cognitive deficits commonly observed in animal models of PD. As a first step, we performed a systematic review of the literature. Our initial search resulted in 520 studies from all databases. After excluding duplicate studies, 282 articles were assessed, of which 89 were selected following inclusion criteria. Based on the reviewed literature, we set protocols for our PD model generation and carried out a battery of experiments to assess possible behavioral alterations following stereotaxic surgery for bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusion into the dorsal striatum to produce a partial loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Until now we performed the footprint, open field, sucrose, social interaction and splash tests, and our finds showed that the model hadn’t gait disturbance and present an anxious/depressive-like behavior. In the next months, more behavior tests will be conducted soon, as well as an electrophysiological recording. 
Thus, I believe that Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School will be the perfect opportunity to improve my knowledge of some techniques. In these, previous results, Bonsai tools were fundamental to track animals in some behavioral tests analysis. And in our laboratory, we use Bonsai and Arduino to synchronize the local field potential and video recordings. But several other functions have not yet been explored by us, for example we intend to implement a closed-loop system that can be done with Bonsai. Furthermore, we are trying to implement the use of DeepLabCut software to improve our behavioral test analysis. The knowledge of Arduino programming will also be required to understand the circadian cycle of our PD model. We intend to build a box using Arduino to track the behavior profile of animals over 24h. Finally, having the opportunity to learn Python will help me to improve my programming skills. And having the first contact with 3D printing, will contribute to the development of several useful materials to the laboratory, the construction of experimental paradigms and training materials for future new group members.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One of the biggest experimental problems that we recently faced was the reproducibility of behavioral data. It is a theme that has been discussed all over the world in the last years and, analyzing some data in our PD review, is a topic that we are also meeting. Furthermore, we are noticing in our review that there seems to be no cohesion in the literature for generating the PD models, the papers use mass and volume of the neurotoxin quite differently. When it comes to sleep classification in the electrophysiological recordings, the literature had several classification problems, such as strategies used are not well described, closed source software or classifiers developed without satisfactory accuracy.

* Having enough funding will enable the initiation of a study that could potentially change much of what is known about managing and treating Parkinson’s disease. This study consists of using stem cells to repopulate mainly the Substantia Nigra pars compacta, the principal nuclei affected in disease. Currently, academic research is very focused on understanding the symptoms, disease progression and treatment of some specific symptoms, but none of these alternatives are able to reverse the clinical picture. Furthermore, the clinical diagnosis is done late and the symptoms treatment in patients is only palliatively. The main hypothesis of this work is that if we administer stem cells directly, it will be possible to repopulate the neurons that constitute the Substantia Nigra pars compacta.
To execute this project will be necessary an interdisciplinary group. With (1) a team responsible for stem cell culture and in vitro test; (2) a team for handling and test an animal (rat) model, inducing the lesion, applying the treatment with stem cell and analyzing the behavioral aspect after transplant; and, everything working, the last (3) team responsible for develop the treatment in a clinical trial. Taking into account my experience with animal experimentation and care, project development and conduction, I will fit better in team 2, delegating the other parts to collaborators. There would be a need to keep these transplanted stem cells in the damaged area, these cells must become part of the region’s circuitry and assume a functional behavior. So finally, not only reverse the symptoms, but also cure them once for all.

* My name is Agustin Eleazar Lara and I have a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the School of Exact and Natural Sciences (University of Buenos Aires), with a major in Animal Physiology and Neuroscience (equivalent to an MSc). My PhD supervisor is Dr Fernando Locatelli, and I have been working with his group since 2016. My PhD project is titled "Segregation of appetitive and aversive odours in the olfactory system of insects". The aim of my research is to characterise the importance and role of two neuronal tracts of the olfactory circuit in honeybees, the l-alt and the m-alt, within the aversive and appetitive sensory modalities. 
The topics covered in this course match my scientific interests and needs. The central question of my PhD is whether appetitive and aversive olfactory information is segregated in two different tracts of PNs (projection neurons) that carry olfactory information from the antennal lobes (primary processing area) to the mushroom bodies (central processing area) in the honeybee brain. There are several hypotheses about the different roles of these two olfactory pathways, whether they function independently or in concert, or whether the segregation responds to a computational need to separate different aspects of stimuli (i.e. intensity vs. identity). 
To address these topics, I rely heavily on behavioral experiments, particularly aversive and appetitive associative learning. Many of these experiments are conducted to demonstrate behavioral patterns that confirm the associations between olfactory and gustatory stimuli. To accomplish this, I use recordings of bees. Because of this, I believe that learning to use deeplabcut would be highly beneficial, as it would simplify and automate the video analysis process.
Additionally, I am currently designing a behavioral setup that will allow me to place a bee in a sphere where it can walk while attached to a structure. This setup will enable me to track the bee's path before and after learning and exposing it to different olfactory stimuli. To aid in the development of my experimental setup and future experiments, I would greatly benefit from learning how to use Bonsai, creating 3D pieces, and utilizing Arduino as a decisive tool. 
Finally, attending this course will allow me to meet and interact with other scientists from around the world who are working on different topics but using similar tools. This interaction would benefit us all, as it would allow us to have a support network to go to when a problem or question arises. I think that a course with these characteristics will be very good for promoting interaction between students and lecturers, giving students another important source of knowledge.
I hope you will consider my application for the course and thank you in advance.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The primary experimental problem I typically encounter in my PhD project is finding a way to demonstrate aversive conditioning within my protocols. The standard olfactory protocols used in bees often result in binary responses, where a conditioning stimulus such as quinine associated with an odour results in the absence of a proboscis extension response (PER).
As a result, I am trying to find different methods to detect behavioural variables that reveal conditioning and allow me to infer how aversive and appetitive information is processed and affects behavioural output. This problem is particularly challenging because the absence of a behavioural response does not necessarily imply the absence of conditioning.
To address this issue, I am exploring novel ways of recording and analysing behavioural variables to reveal the effects of aversive conditioning on bee behaviour. I believe that developing new methods to measure and quantify these variables will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying aversive learning and the impact of these processes on behaviour.

* If I had enough funding and time for a side project, I would like to map the entire connectome of the honey bee Apis mellifera and gain a better understanding of how these animals encode information from sensory input to behavioural output. With this information, I could develop neural models that predict behavioural output from sensory input. To achieve this goal, I would use techniques such as CRISPR or other genetic techniques that have recently been used in bees as genetic tools to target neurons, synapses and neuronal activity, similar to what has long been used in Drosophila.

However, this approach is not only expensive, but also requires a lot of infrastructure to keep bees indoors. Therefore, I would delegate this part of the project to others, while I would focus on the neural modelling aspect of the research, as I am interested in understanding the computational power of the different information processing centres in Apis mellifera.

As we know, bees are of great ecological importance and this research could be used in conjunction with robotics to create artificial intelligence systems capable of working alongside bees to pollinate, thereby reducing the ecological damage that could be caused by the decline in bee populations worldwide. Mapping the entire neural system, understanding how information is processed and using machine learning techniques to simulate these processes would be a major project with not only scientific impact but also ecological and computational significance. The impact of this project would not be limited to the scientific community, but would also help address ecological concerns on a global scale. Although bees are less complex organisms than mammals or humans, their ecological importance makes this project incredibly relevant and meaningful to me.

* Both, my research fellowship and the limited grants provided by my institution cannot afford to cover the costs associated with attending international courses. Being in South America, it is really difficult to have access to international courses, not only because of the cost of flying or travel, but also because of the unfavourable currency. I really appreciate this opportunity and would really appreciate it if you could consider helping to make this possible.

* Title: Study of wakefulness, sleep and cortical electrical activity in a pharmacological model of depression.

Depression is a disorder that still does not have a clear pathophysiology. The monoaminergic hypothesis is the most accepted. This posits that depression is produced by a synaptic deficiency of monoamines. Reserpine (RES), a monoamine release inhibitor, produces symptoms similar to depression, being used as a pharmacological model of depression.
This disorder presents with decreases in cognitive functions, as well as alterations in the sleep-wake cycle. In this cycle, 3 behavioral states are distinguished: wakefulness, non-REM sleep (NREM) and REM sleep. These states can be differentiated by the electroencephalogram (EEG), where it is highlighted that the power of the gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and their coupling between different cortical areas, differ between the states. The gamma band has been shown to be involved in cognitive functions.
The monoaminergic system is part of the activating systems (AS), which are responsible for regulating wakefulness and sleep. The activity of the different components of AS varies in different states. These modifications of the neuromodulation systems that occur during the sleep-wake cycle are considered to play a role in the modulation of the gamma band. Damage to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta has been shown to reduce gamma activity. Therefore, the present project proposes the monoaminergic system as the one responsible for modulating cortical gamma activity.

In this project, 3 large experiments are carried out.
1) Electroencephalographic study of the different frequency components, our laboratory being experienced in the subject.
2) Measurement of monoaminergic levels in different cortical regions of interest by HPLC.
3) Behavioral studies, to show that the animal actually expresses depressive behavior (through a forced swimming test), and that this depressive-type behavior is not caused by a decrease in locomotor activity. We intend to approach this last item in 2 ways: a- through open field studies and b- through studies in the polysomnographic recording box (these boxes have an upper camera). For this last item, it would be of great help to acquire the knowledge offered at the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School. I am currently learning deeplabcut and bonzai in a self-taught way to apply these tools to behavioral studies. In addition to the use of these tools in my project, there are no scientists in Uruguay with high experience in bonsai and deeplabcut, which really makes it difficult to learn these modern tools. In Udelar, Faculty of Medicine, there is no laboratory that pays for video tracking software services. None of the scientists at the institution use Arduino. These tools could not only facilitate the work and have access to new results in my project, but could also improve productivity and scientific quality within my laboratory and work institution.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The most frequent problems I encounter in the laboratory are related to data analysis and processing. Currently, from the electroencephalographic point of view, we have extensive experience in the analysis of these signals through programming tools such as Python and Matlab, collaborating with different foreign institutions, such as the Center for Sleep and Consciousness of Wisconsin or the Brain Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

On the other hand, our laboratory does not have great experience with the analysis of behavioral experiments. As an example, to carry out behavioral studies in the open field, we recorded the sessions and then transcribed them, counting how long the animal was in the center, among other parameters. These sessions are time dependent, which can be automated with the tools offered in the course.
To cite another example, we use the gentle handling, a sleep deprivation technique, which consumes a lot of the experimenter's time. With the use of tools like arduino we could make a close loop, where it receives the animal's encephalographic signal as input. When this signal loses the characteristics of wakefulness and receives those of slow sleep, a mechanism is executed to wake the animal, such as a sound or a small electrical stimulation to wake the animal. In this way, through the use of these tools, improve the scientific production of our laboratory.

* My project would be focused on the therapeutic properties of noribogaine, the main metabolite of ibogaine. Ibogaine is a substance that is extracted from the root of a plant in Gabon. Both in animal models and in controlled clinical trials, the administration of a single dose of ibogaine has been shown to generate strong antidepressant and antiaddictive effects. The peculiar thing about this substance is that it is rapidly metabolized in the liver to its main metabolite, noribogaine. It is unknown if the psychoactive and therapeutic effects of ibogaine are the product of this substance, its main metabolite, or a synergistic action between both substances. It would be interesting if noribogaine does not have unwanted psychoactive effects, but retains the aforementioned therapeutic properties.

For this, i would perform a different number of experiments:

1) Carry out a study of cortical activity under the effects of noribogaine, in order to observe if there are alterations in the cortical gamma band.

2) Study the antidepressant effects: A depressive rat model can be used, either by a genetic model, by exposure to stressful situations or a pharmacological model such as reserpine.
Each rat's level of depression would be assessed by behavioral tests, such as the amount of time they spend not moving or the amount of time they spend in pleasurable activities, before and after noribogaine treatment.

3) Study the anti-addictive effects: An addiction model can be used in rats, in which an addiction to a substance, such as cocaine or opioids, is induced. The rats' level of addiction would be assessed using behavioral tests, such as the preferred place to consume the substance and the amount of time they spend seeking the substance. After treatment, the same tests would be performed to compare the effects of ibogaine treatment and placebo.

In particular, I would like to take care of the analysis part, both electroencephalographic and behavioral, through tools like Python, Matlab, Bonzai, Deeplabcut. I also really enjoy making the techniques work and setting up setups. I would delegate the daily experimental activities, such as carrying out implants for polysomnography or behavioral experiments

* Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by a diversity of motor symptoms as tremor at rest, muscle rigidity, gait deficiencies, slow and frozen movement and postural instability, among others. However, PD patients also present a variety of non-motor symptoms that profoundly affect patients' quality of life. Studies in patients with PD show that more than 50% suffer from insomnia, fragmented sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, there are non-motor symptoms that develop even before the appearance of the classic motor problems, such as RBD, characterized by loss of muscle atonia during the REM sleep phase, which can lead patients to "represent" your dreams. Notably, 90% of people with RBD eventually develop a neurodegenerative synucleinopathy like PD 10 to 15 years after being diagnosed with RBD. Drosophila disease models have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human neurodegenerative diseases despite the differences in anatomy and scale between human and fly brains. However while fly disease models recapitulate molecular features of disease, it is unknown whether flies can be used to understand how aging and disease affect motor control of gait, as gait and tremor characteristics of fly neurodegeneration models are barely studied due to technical challenges. The aim of my project is study the behavioral effect of human mutations associated with the development of PD and RBD (alpha-Syn, parkin and glucocerebrosidase (GBA)) related with the appearance of movement defects as tremors, body movements during sleep and sleep properties, in young, adult and aged flies in order to assess the progression of symptoms. To characterize movements as gait or tremors in the fly requires track leg movements of freely moving flies from high-speed video, with high accuracy and a machine learning program to produces a series of calculated gait parameters. I think this course will provide me with some of these skills and knowledge that I need to develop my project.

* As you may know science in Argentina is supported by fundings of the National State and when the opportunity arise from foreign funds. In my case I have a scholarship associated with a project which has a small budget that would allow me pay a small part of the course. However, it will be very helpfull receive some others funds that would allow me to cover some extra expenses (such as the flight to Buenos Aires) to be able to attend the course since, I think it will be a great opportunity to begin to understand the use of many tools that I will use during my thesis.

* The main interest of my project is to study the complex interaction between sensory and reward systems in the formation of adaptive behaviors. In particular, I am interested in studying how the primary visual cortex changes the way a visual stimulus is encoded when it acquires behavioral relevance for the animal (e.g. visual cue predicts a reward) and how acetylcholine from the basal forebrain may modulate these plastic responses. To unveil this, we designed a visually cued rewarded task where head-fixed mice are trained to perform a lick sequence after a visual stimulus presentation in order to receive a water reward. During the task, we record electrophysiological activity simultaneously in the primary visual cortex and basal forebrain. We use a microelectrode array chronically implanted to record single unit activity and local field potential. The task is controlled through an Arduino and we use Matlab to analyze behavior and electrophysiological data. 
This course would surely be very useful to me, as we are planning to modify our setup to perform a classical conditioning task where a visual stimulus is associated with a punishment to determine if the coding of temporal expectations of rewards and punishments is equal in the primary visual cortex. I think learning how to design and build a setup using 3D printing will be very helpful to give me ideas and tools to modify my setup. On the other hand, to evaluate if mice learn that the visual cue predicts the punishment, the anticipatory blink response will be analyzed by offline analysis of high resolution videos. So learning about Bonsai is what I need to know how to control and analyze this task. Therefore, I reckon this course will be the perfect occasion to learn from experts, and to discuss and solve many of my doubts about my PhD project. Also, I strongly believe this course will boost my current research work providing me a great training in the design of new experiments, data analysis and a critical discussion of the results obtained.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* During my research, I often encounter electronic noise issues in my setup. This is a common problem doing in vivo electrophysiology with freely moving animals and, despite my efforts to minimize noise, my setup is particularly prone to noise, which can be frustrating and affect the quality of my recordings. The sources of noise can be mysterious and difficult to identify, such as when noise appears when someone switched on and off a piece of equipment in the lab next-door. To address these issues, I often seek advice from my colleagues who are engineers and have expertise in electronics.
In addition, I always encounter the challenge of ensuring that the electrodes are placed in the brain area of interest. This problem is particularly prevalent when working with small and ventral areas such as the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which is one of the nuclei of the basal forebrain that projects to the primary visual cortex. Since the electrodes we use are custom-made, and the mouse brain can vary slightly from the atlas, the theoretical coordinates we aim for in implant surgeries may have small variations, especially in small brain areas. The variability in bregma can further exacerbate this issue. Despite our best efforts to ensure accurate placement, even slight variations can lead to electrode placement outside the area of interest.

* 
If I have enough funding and, more importantly, time I would like to undertake a side project focused on the study of how the medial prefrontal cortex and the inputs from the ventral hippocampus contribute to high-order cognitive and emotional processes. It has become clear that a breakdown in inter-regional coordination is likely an important pathophysiological mechanism in various psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and autism, as well as in neurological disorders. Therefore, I aim to investigate the role of medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampal neurons in processing high-order information like social information. To study this, we plan to record electrophysiological activity simultaneously in the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral hippocampus using a microelectrode array chronically implanted to record single unit activity and local field potential while mice are exposed to social interaction tasks. For this project I will focus on the construction of the microelectrode array, the implant surgery, and the electrophysiological recordings. On the other hand, I would like to delegate the aspects of behavioral experiment design and analysis of behavior to a colleague with more expertise in these areas. Additionally, me and other team members will be dedicated to analyzing the electrophysiological data, including MATLAB coding and sorting. I believe that teamwork is essential to effectively manage large-scale projects and increase productivity and efficiency. Moreover, diversity of backgrounds, expertise, and viewpoints among team members can lead to more comprehensive and innovative solutions. Overall, working in groups can lead to increased collaboration, creativity, and productivity.

* Yes, I need financial support to cover the school fee. I am a PhD student at the University of Buenos Aires, and I have been awarded a five-year  fellowship from CONICET (Argentina National Research Council) to fund my studies. Due to the economic crisis that is taking place in Argentina, my monthly wage as well as the budget for science projects are very limited. It is therefore extremely difficult to attend these kinds of international courses these days. In addition, there are scarcely any opportunities to apply for national grants. Considering that it is very difficult to find courses of the prestige and level of this course, I hope funding won't be an obstacle to my participation.

* My genetic model at work is Drosophila melanogaster. I am currently working in two different projects. The first one revolves around the description and understanding of the neuroendocrine signals and circuits that allows the succession on contractions involved in the pupariation behavior. This is a complex behavior, critical for the survival of the animal, and is divided in four very stereotypic behavioral subprograms. In this project, we try to understand how it is possible to obtain such patterns with only one initial trigger, the release of the dilp8 hormone from the carcass. We have recently discovered that three neuropeptides are key to the correct behavioral performance, and we aim to fully understand which neuronal circuits are involved and how. The recording of this behaviors and the analysis of videos have been a fundamental aspect of this study, and we keep on trying to figure out how to do it to get the maximum amount of information possible. For this project, I used a behavioral arena design by my supervisor, learned to build it and to use the program using python. The state of our programs is rudimentary but solid, and we are in constant look for optimization and improvement. On top of it, one of my goals is to increase my programming knowledge to create new ways of analyze our videos. 
My second project is centered in feeding behavior in larvae.  We have recently published that larvae mutant for osi (a gene involved in regulation of lipid metabolism during development) have an aberrant feeding behavior. While control larvae stay in the food, permanently feeding, osi depleted larvae wander around the arena until their premature death. Additionally, downregulation of osi in a specific tissue, the fat body, has a different effect: they feed, at least enough to survive, but the excavation behavior typical of controls is defective. Based on recent unpublished results, we believe we may be facing a signaling issue, where the metabolic signals from the fat body are affected, and the brain produces a deleterious behavior in response. For this project, one of the short to medium term goals is to build a behavioral arena to record larvae moving around the food, and to record the larvae excavating tunnels. This is a new and exciting opportunity for me, to be able to think, build and program a set-up from scratch, and it will be perfect to be able to attend this School.   

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* In recent times, I started to shift my focus in the lab. I returned from my postdoc with a high drive to develop my own path in behavioral neuroscience. In this context, we are starting to plan the building of new set ups to record the behaviors of our larvae. This is not only an exciting new challenge per se, but it is reinforced by our budget limitations: we plan to use 3D printing and other tools in order to compensate for lack of possibility to buy an already existing equipment. On the other hand, making our own set up gives us the opportunity to optimize it to meet our precise needs. Following this, it is my priority to learn all I can about the thought process behind the design of an experimental arena, and all the tools to build and program it.

* If I had enough funding, time and opportunities, I would love to address the following questions: what make us choose one thing over another? And, specifically, what make us choose aggression in a context where is not the only option? I would love to implement one of the paradigms for sex-specific aggression in Drosophila. I am convinced that understanding the real biological aspects of behavior is key to define what is “inevitable” and what is really a choice, and consequently, how to improve our conditions in order to make that choice less likely. 
I would love to lead such a project, to design the experiments and analyze the data. I would love to collaborate with some groups around the world with great experience in the field of sexual behavior/aggression. 
In a context of enough founding, I would pay for the salary of a technician with expertise in molecular biology to produce and optimize genetic tools for Drosophila, and two PhD students to share the fly work

* My project is called “Non coding RNAs and their synaptic activity modulation”, which is focused on the study of a recently characterized molecule, the circular RNAs (circRNAs). As their functions and molecular mechanisms are not well known yet, the main goal of this project is to perform a functional characterization of a previously selected group of circRNAs that may be involved in the function and stability of the synapsis. For this goal, I perform electrophysiological and morphological analysis in hippocampal primary cell cultures, where I previously downregulated a circRNA of interest. This leads to the selection of the most promising candidates to continue working with in in utero electroporation, with the objective of getting an adult mice and doing ex-vivo electrophysiology and behavioural testing. In parallel, we are waiting for knocked out mice to arrive at the lab and to characterize them also electrophysiologically and behaviourally.
I believe that this school can help me in several aspects. On the one hand, to refine the analysis I am getting from my experiments. From my electrophysiological recordings, I generated my own scripts with open source tools, but they may not be optimal and they are open to changes for improvement. I am certain that in this field it is increasingly necessary to update and nourish ourselves with new tools like programing that facilitate tasks and allow us to take advantage of the information we receive from an experiment, expand and re-understand it, especially when using living beings. 
On the other hand, having faced the work in an electrophysiology setup, I understand that it is not a mere instrument that we turn on at the moment of recording and turn off when we finish. Working in this area implies understanding the functioning of the tools we use to record, even if that means covering areas of knowledge for which we were not fully trained at the university. In this area it is increasingly necessary to know how to build your own setup to be able to measure what you are interested in, especially in Argentina where it is not easy to buy equipment specially designed to perform a certain measurement. I think the tools that the course can give are extremely valuable in relation to the assembly of own setups using 3D printing and Arduino, tools that give us the opportunity to do high-quality science and are at our fingertips. In my specific case, these tools will allow me to diagram my behavioural experiments with electroporated or knock out mice in order to design specific setups to test particular aspects related to the behavioural phenotype that we create distinctive.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* There are two drawbacks that I have when it comes to doing my experiments. The first one, which presents itself to me every time I am faced with data analysis, is the complexity of the recordings that I obtain and their processing. Although programming is my tool par excellence when visualizing and processing data, I am aware that I have limitations at the time of its use. However, I manage to solve the presented issues, but I know that it takes me much more time than it should, I get to outputs that I then find it difficult to polish, or I am not able to get the most out of the data. The other drawback is related to a very specific hitch in my current job. I usually take recordings of miniature currents, which can be very noisy and the analysis requires supervised identification. Although in the laboratory we use a “homemade” miniature identification program, there is an instance of supervised review that is very strenuous, but mostly subject to the experimenter interpretation. I would like to have the ability to refine such a program, and I believe that nowadays that issue is beyond my knowledge in the area.

* To this question I have two possible answers.
If I had enough money and people to carry out a project, the first theme that comes to my mind is climate change remediation. I consider that what I have just mentioned is the most urgent and important problem to be solved in the near future, and I certainly think that someone with money, time, and manpower should be solving this priority issue. However, it would be a project for which I did not focus my training and also my particular interest is in another area of knowledge, related to the following aspect.
A project that I would be fascinated to work on, and in which I could fully intervene, has to do with the evolution of the brain. I imagine a large-scale study, involving all possible organisms with nervous systems, from jellyfish to mammals, reaching all the known complexities. My plan would be to put together a large project that demands experiments in molecular biology, behaviour, physiology, evo-devo, aiming to establish molecular, genetic, cellular, circuitry and behavioural parallelisms. Although evolutionary neuroscience is a field that is already being explored, there are no large-scale studies with professionals working at the same time for a common project. The study should have a special focus on interdisciplinarity within the fields of biology. The tasks where I would like to be involved in are in circuit and behavioural experiments, performing ex vivo and in vivo tests, combining last generation technologies such as optogenetic and single-cell recordings, two photon imaging, and so on. Although my expertise is in mice, I don’t want to rule out innovating experimentally in other organisms. I would delegate the molecular evolution experiments as I am more interested in focusing my work on the complex processes of connectivity and behavioural patterns, but not so much at the molecular level related to genetics. Above all, the thing that I would be particularly interested in is to be involved in the global theoretical discussion, putting forward hypotheses and discussing the results of all areas.

The scholarship would be a great opportunity for me to be able to attend this course that I believe will help me a lot with my proyect and fulfill my training goals as a scientist.

* I am doing my PhD using as a model the leaf cutting ant Acromyrme Ambiguus. My aim is to unravel individual and collective preference of foragers ants from Delta del Paraná colonies regarding native plant species of the same region. Thought behavioural assays we analyse different sensory modalities for this preference. For the most and least consumed native plant species, we study innate and plasticity colony preference in foragers, both individual and collectively. Moreover, we are working on identification of plant volatile composition and electroantennograms with them. 
Regarding how the school may impact in my research I believe that experience such as this one are inflection points personally and professionally, specially being a latina women in neuroscience. Often I see myself under impostor syndrome. I find it difficult to encourage myself to do projects that involve programming and certain technologies that I do not know, such as Arduino and Bonsai in this course. I had already modified (and improved) some designs of behavioural experiments with 3D printing and quickly saw the impact in my work. I am confident that the hands-on tutorial on designing and building, as well as open-source tools, for experimental set-ups will be life changing for my carear. 
 I think that the tools this course offers are foundational for years to come science. So this concepts will help me rethinking experiments to come and broaden my scope regarding post-doc possibilities. It will help me engage in discussions with scientist from different fields and gain new insights about the latest developments in their fields. Even though their fields might not be close related to mine I am sure that we can spread enthusiasm, new perspectives and ideas. Moreover, TBNSS will give me the possibility to networking with top researchers from diverse backgrounds and regions. 
I am sure that assisting to this course will help my to develop into a better scientist, allowing me to design more efficiently my experiments and set-ups and to analyse and interpret better my results.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One of the typical experimental problems is the difficulties in tracking one or several ants at the time while they are foraging collectively. They are hardly identifiable as they walk closely or over one another, especially the smaller individuals. 
Additionally, our experimental arenas are somewhat static. In the sense that we do not have equipment that allows the presence of the stimulus to be dependent on the animals' behaviours. For example, I am about to set up an experimental devise that allows an ant to be in a platform in which two volatile stimuli are presented simultaneously and the animal is allowed to reach one of them. In this case, the stimulus is on before the animal enters the platform and the air flow is not modified. With more knowledge the airflow could be presented in an increasing/decreasing manner. Even, the flows could be turned on/off or modified based on the number/position of ants in a behavioural arena. Finally, this kind of flow control device also could be used in ant electroantennogram.

* If I would have enough time, funding and people to work with I would like to focus on odour information flows and it’s plasticity (at behavioural and neuronal level). As leaf cutting ants are a marvellous and complex system I would be interested in study the flow information and plasticity towards odour stimuli at different levels such as: foragers with direct contact to stimuli/ foragers to foragers/ foragers inside the colony / foragers to gardeners (the ones taking care of the fungus that they use to feed the broad). I would like to identify and track individual ants and they behaviour as the information flow through the colony. Besides I would like to set up a device that can present an stimulus in an specific point in the experimental arena or in the presence of an specific behaviour, even inside the colony at specific parameters/behaviours. I would like to do electroantennograms of naive or experience ants ants of different cast in a colony in response to odour stimuli and find out if direct or indirect experience of the foragers can modulate the flux of information plasticity. Finally I would like to work in collaboration to make recordings in Olfactory Sensory Neurons, Antennal Lobe (input and output) to study the coding of this information.

On the one hand, in my lab we have approximately 2.000.- for any expense (except salaries) for five PhD candidates, for two years. On the other hand, I do not have a salary that allows me to invest in a course such as this one, to improve myself both professionally and personally. Therefore, I hope you may give me financial support to assist to the 2023 edition of Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School.

* At the outset, let me state that I'm nearing the end of my degree and the skills gained during the school will not help me with my current project. However, I plan to pursue a PhD after finishing my MS and I expect that these skills will be very useful for me then.

Currently, I'm studying the neural responses of songbirds as they listen to the entire repertoire of vocalizations used by them. This is a computational study using an open dataset (we don't have experimental facilities at our institute to record neural data). I chose this dataset as I wanted to study the computational mechanisms underlying classification of vocalizations in the auditory cortex. Specifically, I wanted to look at the differential roles of A1 and A2 in this process. I found that A2 forms higher dimensional representations and contains significantly more information about the vocalization type as compared to A1.

For my PhD, I would like to do behavioral experiments as well. I strongly believe that if a hypothesis can be tested behaviorally, we should not perform invasive recordings. Additionally, studying behavior in conjunction with neural activity can help us form a much richer understanding. Indeed, behavioral experiments can reveal directions that can be better explored by computational approaches. The school's focus on the relationship between brain and behavior in the context of the whole organism, its needs, natural environment, and evolution aligns with my research interests. I believe that understanding the neural basis of complex behaviors in the context of the organism's ecological niche is essential to advance our understanding of the brain's functions.

Attending the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School will be an excellent opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience with behavioral experiments and data analysis. Specifically, the tutorials on experimental design and data analysis using open-science tools such as 3D printing, Arduino, and Bonsai will provide me with the necessary skills to design and execute my own behavioral experiments in the future.
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* As a computational researcher working with open datasets, one of the biggest challenges I face is the lack of experimental control on the data that I'm working with. Unlike experimental researchers who have control over the stimuli presented to animals or humans, I have to rely on pre-existing data sets that may not have been designed to answer the specific research questions that I'm interested in. Additionally, the quality of the data can vary, and there may be missing or incomplete information that needs to be addressed before it can be used for analysis.

Not having any prior experience with behavioral research, I will face many experimental problems in the beginning. For example, not being familiar with state of the art paradigms in behavioral research will be a barrier to designing good experiments. And not having any prior hands-on experience will mean that I'll have to spend time learning about the methods from people that are already good at them.

* Big Question: It is known that in blind subjects, the brain repurposes the visual cortex to process other kinds of information (e.g., auditory, tactile, etc.) What happens to this non-visual information processing in blind subjects when vision is restored?

To study this question, we can utilize behavioral as well as computational approaches. We can benchmark subject performance on certain tasks before the vision is restored, and then compare it to their performance after their vision is restored. Simultaneously, we can record neural data and look for changes in neural activity in the visual cortex.

In such a study, I would like to help design the experiments to minimize confounds (as there can be many potential confounds here such as the length of time that the subject has been blind, age, neurological conditions, and any special training received by subjects). I'd like the experiment design to be a collaborative process, with inputs from researchers who have experience designing tasks to measure performance on non-visual tasks. I would like to do the computational analyses myself. I would like to delegate conducting the actual experiments to others.

* Schizophrenia is a disorder that usually affects young people at puberty and
demonstrated by a disturbance of cognition and emotion, together with symptoms negatives and positives. Although its etiology is still unknown, some theories have presented regarding the origin of the disease. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis states that abnormalities in the neurodevelopmental process can promote activation of pathological neuronal circuits during adolescence or adulthood, giving origin of the symptoms. To study this hypothesis, the animal model employed is based on
 the administration of a mitotoxin, methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), during
gestation of the rat, with the aim of inducing an arrest of development. Thus,
pharmacological interventions that are able to prevent these changes can be
new strategies for treating the disease. The purpose of my research project is to employ repeated treatment with Cannabidiol (CBD) as a pharmacological intervention, and analyze its ability to prevent or reverse changes caused by the model MAM. In addition, electrophysiological analyzes will be performed in order to evaluate the number of spontaneously active dopaminergic neurons. For this purpose, rats from Sprague–Dawley strains will be treated with MAM or saline on gestational day 17, and the male offspring will be treated for 7 days with CBD at a dose of 60mg/Kg. When they reach adulthood (postnatal day 62), these animals will be evaluated through of the elevated plus maze, light/dark, object recognition and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. I believe that participating in this conceptual debate, having contact with new ideas and different tools for behavioral neuroscience would add a lot to my research, and I would love to participate.

* The difficulties of schizophrenia models are the subjectivity of the symptoms, the difficulty in reproducing them in animals and the clinical complexity to be totaled. Schizophrenia probably has multiple etiologies, involving interactions between genetic and environmental factors and producing complex nervous dysfunction. In addition, it involves higher functions, such as abstraction and language, which are impossible to access in animals. It is a
phenotype so complex that it can only be approached in animals by separating its components.

* I am very interested in behavioral neuroscience, so I would like to participate in other projects involving behavior in other neurological pathologies. I am also very interested in Cannabidiol and its various pharmacological effects. Currently, CBD has attracted significant interest due to its diverse effects.
pharmacological, including neuroprotective properties, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic and antipsychotic. Thus, the endocannabinoid system is a promising new pharmacological target for this respect. Endocannabinoid-mediated regulation of synaptic transmission is a widespread phenomenon in the brain and is believed to play an important role in higher brain functions such as cognition, motor function and memory. I would like to do the most practical part of the experiments, and I would delegate the statistical analyzes to someone else with more knowledge in the field.

* I started my own researcher project, thanks to funding ADVANCEDBestStudentGRANT, this project combines my interests with my double major and its aim is to synthesize new derivatives of tryptophan to improve its biological properties.
Thus, the project concerns the synthesis of new fluorophore derivatives of tryptophan, which are expected to improve the permeability of this amino acid across the BBB and the metabolism.
The compounds I get will be the subject of biological research, which I will pursue om my second major - Neurobiology, as part of my master's thesis at the Medical University of Poznan. The subject of the thesis will be the evaluation of transport across the BBB and selected biological properties of the new tryptophan fluorophores, which I will verify using an in vitro cellular model of the BBB. And by evaluating the interaction of these compounds with specific transporters for serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, I will identify the potential antidepressant effects of these new tryptophan derivatives, which I previously synthesized in my research project.
If the biological studies will confirm good properties and a potential therapeutic effect, I would like to apply for the possibility of further behavioral studies. I have no too much experience with behavioral research, but I would like to acquire this skill. To be able to conduct research from micro to macro scale. I like to invent and project things, some stuff, even things that seem abstract. I would like to learn and use the possibility of access to various tools in neuroscience (ad not only).
 Everything that is related to neuroscience, human body, behaviour and mental. Physiology, clinical research, therapy of neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, neurotransmission. I am also interested in the effects of psychoactive substances from the cellular level through effects on the whole body and behavior and possible therapeutic potential of psychoactive substance. Also interested in neurotransmission and its translation into everyday life and psychology. I am also interested in healthy living and nutrition.
I am an undergraduate with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. I am studying two majors concurrently: Neurobiology (Master‘s degree) and Biological Chemistry (Bachelor's degree). Neurobiology is my main interest, however I find that both majors complement each other very well and I would like to combine them in my future career. I would like to develop my competencies and gain new experiences in order to be able to do groundbreaking research. Also, I would like to change a little bit my perception and creative thinking which is necessary to become a scientist.
I also want to go for a PhD related to neuroscience and become a scientist in the future and contribute for the benefit of humanity.

# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* Reactions that did not want to happen. Lack of adequate experience, models and conditions to conduct more advanced research/experiments. Tools and courses are too expensive. Often if I want go for an internship it is not possible to do this before graduate master's. Small places in Poznan which are intersting formy future carrier. Don't know how saome tools are working, I mean their mechanism.  I would also like to learn to program (in the context of the possibility in research). I'm just starting to dabble in a career as a scientist, and I hope to solve the problems I encounter with curiosity and great creativity. I will certainly not give up on them. I highly value cognition and pathways, not only the aim.

* It would depend on the common interest of the people in the group. It is important to use different abilities and skills to diversify the project. It is important in science to have a broad view of an issue. I would certainly like something new but tested with potential terpetic properties. I would like to test the effect on behavior in a single individual , as well as in a group. And how different conditions can affect the sensations and effects of a substance (for example, administering it under conditions when there is only one individual, administration in the nature, administration under conditions of a techno party), try mix to test the interaction with other substances, or test in various disorders.

* Across social species, animals are known to naturally form social dominance hierarchies that facilitate group survival and maintain social stability during competition for limited resources. Social ranking within these hierarchies is hypothesized to be learned and established by information derived from social experiences with other members of the group. Obstacles in understanding the neuronal contributions to the complexity social behaviors and how these are influenced by social status arise from limitations in computer vision, specifically when trying to capture the full available repertoire of whole-body movements between multiple animals, just as it typically occurs in nature. To address these gaps, my research created a novel platform that takes pose estimates from multiple freely moving mice and uses unsupervised clustering methods to identify behavioral motifs, which in combination with single-cell resolution calcium imaging, will allow us to quantify the multidimensional, dynamic relationship between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neuron activity, social ranks, and ethologically relevant social competition behaviors. Here for the first time, we are testing the hypothesis that OFC neurons encode social rank and are part of top-down circuits that guide behaviors during social competition based on social rank.

Our preliminary findings show that reward acquisition does not correlate with social rank unless it occurs within a social competition context, supporting a model in which competence is flexibly manifested as a function of dominance status. As I conduct calcium imaging experiments as animals engage in social competition, I look forward to applying the conceptual and technical skills learned in the summer school to model the relationship between OFC encoding of social rank and social competition behaviors, which will aid in answering the open question of whether OFC guides the flexible expression of social behaviors. Specifically, the tutorials on Arduino and Bonsai will immensely aid me in conducting a closed-loop experiment in which OFC activity is perturbed during specific behavioral motifs during social competition as a mean to test the necessity of social rank encoding in this region in the expression of dominance behaviors. I plan to do this by synching video recordings and live pose estimation through DeepLabCut in Bonsai with Inscopix single-cell resolution calcium imaging paired with optogenetics (through the implantable nVoke system). As a fan of open-science tools, I aim to make my analysis and Bonsai synchronization pipeline publicly available upon successful completion of these experiments.

* Neural circuit dissection requires precision of viral techniques and surgical implants in ensuring that activity recordings and associated manipulations are correctly attributed to the targeted neural population. A typical experimental problem for me is validating anatomical targeting through multiple iterations of intracranial surgeries. But now that my project is moving towards parallel activity recordings and activity manipulations, my current experimental problems now involve having to program custom Arduino setups that can reliably synch this activity to task events, such as trial initiation. While I had some minimal experience doing this in my PhD, this process is now much more difficult as I have had to build my own custom behavioral boxes, and thus have to improvise the wiring of the box and its components (e.g. doors, reward release, etc). Beyond these technical challenges, another experimental problem I encounter in my research is the classification of behavioral motifs. While I currently use unsupervised clustering techniques to identify components of complex social behaviors, some of these are difficult to interpret due to the multiple variables at play as a consequence of the behavior occurring between multiple freely moving animals. Coming up with an unbiased way to assign meaning to some motifs that look similar is one of my ongoing challenges.

* Orbitofrontal cortex processes are thought to be mediated by vast neuromodulatory innervation from subcortical structures known to regulate sociability, such as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Serotonergic (5-HT) DRN neurons have been identified as a key neural substrate for mediating social interaction behaviors and they provide the majority of serotonergic innervation to the OFC. However, it is unclear whether DRN5-HT-OFC circuits can process social ranking information to influence behaviors dictated by social ranks both within a familiar social group and amongst a larger social structure encompassing multiple unfamiliar groups.

To investigate this, I would like to create an environment in which mice have access to their home cage and a larger arena in the middle designed to look like their natural environment. Mice would have the opportunity to interact with their familiar cagemates as well as members of other cages within this open arena. I would like to analyze video recordings in conjunction with chronic serotonin sensor neural implants in each animal to capture the contribution of orbitofrontal serotonin activity to the natural evolution of social ranks amongst this larger mouse society in relation to their own hierarchies amongst cagemates. This paradigm would allow for a variety of different manipulations, such as resource availability, access to mates and territory marking patterns, all to ultimately investigate the complexity of social interaction behaviors and the establishment of societal status in large groups. Currently, this is a bit tricky due to the large expenses and computational power required to record video and neural activity signals 24/7, but with enough resources we could really get at how one’s position within a familiar and unfamiliar social hierarchy is represented in the brain to guide the appropriate expression of social behaviors.

Personally, I would like to be most involved in the analysis and behavioral task design aspect of the project while delegating the day-to-day maintenance of the arena and animals to research assistants. However, I will happily teach them the necessary computational skills so that they could investigate subprojects of their own using the data collected from this paradigm.

* My background as an immigrant and first-generation college student is intertwined with financial difficulty during the entirety of my research career. As my family continues to struggle with poverty, I depend immensely on scholarships and fellowships that have allowed my education and professional development to continue. I currently possess no funds to attend summer workshops, and while there are some funds for professional travel available through the Salk Institute, these are highly competitive, and while I will try my best to be awarded, these funds are not a guarantee.

* My project involves the study of recognition memory in mice. Recognition memory depends on identification and judgment of the prior occurrence of events. It is a very sensitive declarative memory and the use of its temporal component might have a relevant predictive power for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
I've previously characterized a Temporal Order Recognition Memory (TORM) induced by a two-session protocol in mice (a variant of the novel object recognition task that involves the discrimination of temporality) and my results show that mice retain memory and discriminate the recent from the further familiar object evaluating both short and long term memory.
I also initiated the study of molecular and cellular bases underlying the learning of this task. I aim to describe the role of the ERK pathway in different mouse brain areas as well as its subcellular location using the temporal object recognition task, which will allow me to stablish the foundations to later deepen the study in a model of neurodegenerative pathologies like AD.
The skills and knowledge gained during the school will help us accurately track and analyze the exploratory behaviour of mice, and fully seizing the information captured on each video. Also, we hope to develop better statistical models that allow us to understand how variables such as the sex of the mice and it´s litter of procedence may affect behavior. Just reciently our group has acquired the necessary hardware to make proper use of DLC, and I am very excited to get to see how we can improve our analysis with it.
Finally, I believe that this experience will be of great benefit for me as it will allow me to start my PhD career with the right tools. 
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* I record the sessions in which the mice explore the objects and then cuantify the exploration time manually, which takes a lot of time and is not informative in terms of ammount of interactions with each object, and distance travelled by each mouse (which can be used to assess it´s levels of anxiety). With DLC and bonsai, I would be able to seize the information captured on each video and make better use of each session.
Also, I work with male and female mice, which becomes a statistical challenge when it comes to analyzing the data altogether.

* I would like to study the behavior of jellyfish, evaluating their ability to adapt their behavior to different scenarios (such as the presence of a predator, difficulty in accessing food, or changes in temperature). It seems to me that knowing the functioning of such a primitive nervous system could tell us about the origins of consciousness and memory.
I myself would love to design the aquariums and build the necessary hardware to run the experiments. Someone with more knowledge and experience in handling jellyfish would probably do the experiments, and I would set up the computer software to analyze the movements of each tentacle. Finally, I would need some help analyzing the results, as it can be challenging to determine what is relevant in terms of the behavior of a floating invertebrate.

* Most organisms have bilaterally symmetrical organization of neural circuits. The neurons and commissures connecting the two sides enable the two sides to coordinate for various putative purposes. When the systems are identical on both sides, they may be involved in bilateral comparisons, enabling concurrency and/or redundancy. When there is lateralization of the brain, they may be involved in information transfer from the contralateral side and coordination.
The model organism which I’m using for addressing such questions is a grasshopper (Hieroglyphus banian). My interest is in understanding the role of bilateral neurons connecting the mushroom body lobes that our lab has reported earlier. As part of this we will be using palp opening response (POR) conditioning in grasshoppers assay to see if  grasshoppers show split brain-like phenomena as in honeybees. POR is a conditioning protocol similar to proboscis extension response (PER) which we have in honey bees.These experiments require me to be able to construct experimental setups for behavior  and automated behavioral analysis in tandem with physiology. The intent behind joining this summer school is for acquiring knowledge necessary for analyzing the data from the experiments and also designing my experiments. At present, our lab is using matlab based code for the purpose of tracking but I would like to shift to using DEEPLABCUT for the same for the benefits which it offers like  specifying the region or the body part to be tracked. Tutorials of 3D printing will be helpful in developing setup to develop experiments on our own model organism. I have a basic knowledge of  Arduino before and hence,  I’m  keen on  knowing how different loop experiments can be developed using it and how I can use the learned information. I don’t have any prior knowledge of Bonsai as I have never encountered it before. Hence, this Summer school will provide the opportunity to me to learn something new. 
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* One of the problems which I’m experiencing with my research is the tracking of the movement in the conditioning protocol of POR. Usually, in the videos recorded while conditioning, the major movements get noticed easily but movements which occurred slowly or developed eventually get ignored or remain unnoticed. It only gets realized when the tracking data is analyzed. Hence, tracking the movement of the animal becomes important. But sometimes simultaneous movements occur in various parts of the animal body that some may go under the radar and remain unnoticed. In such a scenario, it is hard to track using custom code which targets only specific colored pixels in the video and ignores the others. It sometimes also requires manual tracking when it loses the track. Though the manual approach makes it reliable, it’s a time consuming process which can be invested in something else. The length of the video to be tracked also dictates the time to be taken to track the movements in it. Similarly, designing the suitable conditioning paradigm and the things required for building up the set up needed for the experiment may not be available sometimes or have  to be customized and designed according to your needs. Thus, techniques like 3-D printing come in handy in such situations.

* Yes, of course, if I have sufficient time apart from my present role as a PhD scholar and the current project I’m working on, here in my institution, then I will be keen on learning and collaborating with others. It is also important for me that the project suits my interests. Then, It will be a great opportunity for me to explore as I'm looking for this kind of exposure where there is an exchange of knowledge. Such collaboration will be helpful for me and my career. It will be nice if it involves the practical application of the techniques being taught in the summer school. 

I have experience in developing the conditioning protocol and analyzing the data obtained from the recording using python code. Hence, I would like to do the part of the project which involves data analysis. I can also design and conduct experiments but it, as i said, would depend on the kind and requirement of the project undertaken. It should be something which I will be able to manage along with my present commitments. Other responsibilities of the project, I would like to delegate to the other  in the project if I have the authority to do so . But since I’m also looking for learning, any new role is also accepted if it is possible in my end.

* My project centres on studying how photoperiod and temperature synchronise the circadian rhythm of behaviour in Gymnotus omarorum, a native weakly electric fish. These fish are characterised by an electric organ discharge (EOD) used in electrolocation and communication. Despite living under very extreme lighting conditions (total darkness for most of the year), they show robust nocturnality, evidenced by a rise in both locomotor activity and in their EOD rate of emission. To this aim I plan to employ behavioural assays in which fish are subjected to stable cycles of light or temperature under otherwise constant conditions, and test whether these environmental cues are able to entrain their behavioural rhythms.
I’m currently in the process of updating the station our lab uses for circadian experiments. It consists of four individual tanks each equipped with a pair of recording electrodes and an overhead camera. Lighting consists of an overhead LED grid, and temperature control relies on individual heating mats. Light and temperature cycles are controlled by timers inside the station. Circadian experiments are very sensitive to environmental disturbances so for example, a very short pulse of light from someone entering the recording station to reset a timer or troubleshoot is enough to endanger the validity of data. My goal now is to adapt the station so that I can control the light/temperature cycles through Arduino, and in turn access the Arduino(s) through Bonsai from a PC outside the station, allowing me to control the station and also correctly program data acquisition (both electric and video) without accessing the station and disrupting the fish. I have some self-taught knowledge in Arduino programming, and have been reading up and testing Bonsai, but a more focused experience in which I can also discuss the issues I face with people specialised in these topics is of immense value to me.
Furthermore, I’ve recently been looking into DeepLabCut as a way to firstly offload some of the effort required when analysing movement through just visual observations, but also to eliminate the inherent subjectivity in these kinds of analysis and to be able to extract more individual activity parameters for a more detailed analysis of movement. On a more personal note, I’m also interested in further training in Python to develop a script capable of extracting movement information from changes in the amplitude of the fish’s electric emissions (which result from them moving relative to the recording electrodes), which would allow me to quantify movement in conditions where video recording is impossible (for example in semi-natural conditions, where animals live under very heavy vegetation).
# What is the typical experimental problem that you usually meet in your research? [max 250 words]
* The main two problems i´ve been running into relate to the control of the environmental parameters in the experimental station and to the processing of data.
As of yet temperature and light are operated and controlled from inside the station itself, and in an independent manner. This has led to issues where a system fails and the only way to fix it is going inside the station and restarting the experiments (which sometimes implies acclimating a new batch of fish).
On the other hand, recordings of electric activity can sometimes be very noisy, which requires carefully processing the recordings and filtering out noise without losing important data. The video recordings are long (a single experiment can take up to three weeks) and observational analysis is slow and prone to error, which has forced me to spend countless hours in front of the screen watching and re-watching videos, time that could be better spent in other tasks if primary video processing is automatized.

* I’m very interested in the mechanisms which underlie rhythmic behaviour. Particularly, I’m interested in how group dynamics in social animals shape individual and population-wide rhythms. In this sense, hymenoptera is a group of great allure to me.
When living in groups, many hymenoptera species show rhythmic patterns (this includes arrhythmicity) that depend on their task within the brood and that disappear or change when in insolation. I’d be very interested in testing the limits of this plasticity, and then find neural correlates that help explain these changes in behaviour. 
This would ideally be a multidisciplinary approach, with a group of people approaching the model from an ethological standpoint, looking into naturally occurring rhythms and how they relate to the specific ecological constraints these animals live under, like food availability, predator presence, etc. This could also include comparisons between populations of the same species living in different habitats or niches. This, apart from a few field trips for personal enjoyment, I´d leave for the ecologists.
I´d feel more comfortable in the lab, conducting behavioural experiments, manipulating the social dynamics of the brood changes the behavioural rhythms of different castes, and also how/if genes involved in circadian regulation and social behaviour co-express to generate predictive patterns of caste behaviour. This could then be contrasted with similar experiments in which members of different castes are placed in isolation, and test how the expression profiles are affected as behaviour does too. I´d also be interested in (as neither time nor money are a constraint) creating selective mutants for some of these genes, and behaviourally testing how neuromodulators involved in social behaviour affect rhythmicity. Further on, it’d be interesting to work with someone interested in connectomics to try to map these networks and check how interconnected they are, and how task division can shape them.

* My research focuses on defining the neural circuits underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. More specifically, the goal of my project is to study atypical neural connectivity within the cerebellum and its connections with other regions in the context of Down Syndrome, which is the most commonly diagnosed chromosomal abnormality and the cause of various cognitive and motor deficits in children across the world. I’m working to understand and link these connections or the deficits thereof to behavioral output in the Ts65Dn and TcMAC21 mouse models. Some of the tools I plan to utilize for my research in the lab include fiber photometry, stereotaxic viral injections for neural tracing, advanced behavioral quantification using the ErasmusLadder in combination with event sensors, custom instrument and workflow design using open hardware and Bonsai, and high density mapping of behavior using DeepLabCut. Since many of these tools will be discussed in the context of experimental setups in the Transatlantic Behavioral Neuroscience Summer School 2023, I believe that being a part of such a workshop will help me improve my research and equip me with valuable skills and ideas that I can incorporate into my research. Open-Science tools that will be worked with in the TBNSS such as Arduino and Bonsai are an essential part of my research. Since I will be designing custom behavioral setups, 3D printing techniques learned from this workshop will enable me to implement my ideas towards these behavioral studies as well. Interacting with leading neuroscientists in the field and being exposed to different ideas and perspectives will also benefit my approach and allow me to explore more ways of answering the questions I have posed in my research. Collaboration with other researchers and learning from them about use and incorporation of the tools discussed in the TBNSS will benefit my project vastly.

* Through my project I’m attempting to better define the role of the cerebellum in Down Syndrome (DS). To achieve this I aim to study DS on multiple levels of organization including different specific cell types such as the Purkinje Cells, connectivity through neural circuits, and behavioral output as well. I will use various tools such as fiber photometry and optogenetics to collect and analyze data obtained from a cellular level as well as Behavioral output data from the ErasmusLadder- an automated tool to quantify cerebellum-dependent behavior. One of the major challenges I face is the integration of these different kinds of data acquisition and analysis while making use of a range of tools. The challenge is to combine and use the streams of data from the multiple levels of organization being studied. My experiments also involve stereotaxic surgeries with mice which are time intensive and can typically take about 45-90 minutes. A challenge of temporal efficiency in the experimental setups is also a typical problem I face during my project that can perhaps be solved with the integration of more automation in experimental designs.

* Given the funding and time, I would like to run a side project to identify common patterns in neural activity underlying various behaviors at a cell and circuit level in multiple brain regions. This would allow me to build a neural compendium that can be used to study different neurological disorders in mouse models across entire life spans. The goal would be to define behavior in terms of activity and extract patterns of spike activity correlating to details of the particular cell types during behavior. I would like to begin by looking at neural activity within the cerebellum for one strain of normal mice at a single stage of post-natal development (eg: Neural activity in the cerebellar cortex of a P30 mouse while running on a rotary wheel). The project would involve designing a simple and standardized behavioral experiment combined with emerging tools like monolithically integrated mesh electronics (Zhao, S et al. 2023) developed recently to chronically detect and record neural activity. Finally, machine learning tools can be used to identify patterns from the multiple datasets to form a compendium of specific behaviors defined by neural activity across various mouse strains, developmental stages, and brain regions. Apart from designing the project, I would prefer to personally oversee the acquisition of data from behavior as well as neural activity. I would prefer to delegate data processing, machine learning, and integration into a database to others on the project. I would also like to collaborate with other researchers working on various other brain regions to study multiple other behaviors to add more input into the compendium.
